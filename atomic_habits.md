# Atomic Habits

Notes for Atomic Habits by James Clear.

# Fundamentals: Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

Atomic habits are tiny (like atoms), the fundamental units that combine to form our lives,
but can become a source of immense energy/power.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Small improvements will accumulate to immense
results. Time magnifies both good/bad habits.

You want positive compounding habits: productivity, knowledge, relationships. Remove the negative
habits: stress, negative thoughts.

**Systems are better than goals.** Systems are the processes you'll create to lead to your goals.
For example: packing your gym bag the night before, so you'll go to the gym first thing in the
morning. Or meal prepping on Sundays to encourage eating healthy during the week. You don't rise
to the levels of your goals, you'll fall to the level of your systems.

Habits shape identity and vice versa. Thinking "I am a healthy person" will encourage you to make
healthier habits. Would a healthy person eat fast food on most days?

Build better habits in four steps:

1. cue - make it obvious
2. craving - make it attractive
3. response - make it easy
4. reward - make it satisfying

Inverted for bad habits:

1. make it invisible
2. make it unattractive
3. make it difficult
4. make it unsatisfying

# The 1st Law: Make It Obvious

Start with awareness. You have existing habits already, but they're so ingrained in day to day life
that they're invisible (eg remote next to couch or phone in pocket).

Make a habit scorecard, a list of daily habits. Put a "+", "-", or "=" next to it if it's positive,
negative, or neutral. Example habits: wake up, check phone, brush teeth, afternoon snack.

**Optimize your environment for your habits.** Context is important: do your work at a coffeeshop,
work out at the gym, and sleep in your bed. Don't work in your bed.

To form a new habit, try habit stacking. You can add a new habit after an existing one. For example,
after I use the restroom I'll do a pull up.

If you're suffering from willpower, it's easier if you don't have to practice self-restraint at all.
Do this by adjusting your environment. It's easier to quit snacking if you don't have snacks at home.
It's easier to floss if you have it laying out on the counter next to your toothbrush.

# The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

Make habits attractive with temptation bundling - link an action you want to do with an action you
need to do. For example, you can only watch Game of Thrones when you're at the gym working out.

Or make a habit more attractive via social proof. If a habit can get us approval, respect, praise
from a social group -- you'll find it more attractive. For example, identity with being an athlete
and post your gym session up on social media. Or join a group of athletes.

**Reframe habits to highlight benefits.** Instead of "I need to run" think "I'm going to build some
endurance". Instead of "I need to save money" think "I'm investing for the future".

# The 3rd Law: Make It Easy

Don't fall into analysis paralysis. We feel like we're in motion when we're planning/learning, but
it doesn't produce results. Take action to deliver success. We tend to prefer motion over action
because it feels like we're progressing without the risk of failure/criticism. You need to take action.

Repetition is better than perfection. Don't worry about perfecting your habit. Just start the reps.

**The less friction, the better. Try the two-minute rule for the smallest version of your habit.**
Instead of a habit to "read a chapter a day", try "read for two minutes a day". Then after you
establish that habit, extend the time. Build out a habit step by step. For example, to become a
vegan: start eating vegetables at each meal, stop eating animals with four legs, stop eating
animals with two legs, stop eating animals with no legs, then stop eating all animal products.

# The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying

Rewarded actions will be repeated. Punished actions will be avoided.

**Create a reward for good habits and a punishment for bad habits.** Habits need to be enjoyable for
them to last long term. That's why we brush our teeth - the reward of refreshing mint flavor. Or
the reward of seeing your savings account increase.

Never miss twice. If your goal is to be healthier, create a system where you work out on a regular
schedule. If you miss a day, do not miss another day. Never miss two workout days in a row.
