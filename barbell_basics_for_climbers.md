# Barbell Basics for Climbers

I took a series of barbell classes offered at First Ascent that taught the three main lifts:

1. deadlift
2. squat
3. press

I wanted to take the classes to have a professional look over my form, so that's what these notes
mostly consist of. Also before each lift, our instructor taught us to do dynamic stretches (or
mobility work) before hand as a warm up. Followed by static stretches after the lift.

# Deadlift

Steps:

1. start with barbell directly over mid-feet above shoelaces
2. feet should be slightly spread apart -- if you direct one foot's toes towards the other, it should
   either be touching OR almost be able to touch the other foot
3. correct posture (shoulders back and down) and tensed core
4. bend knees to pick up bar -- hands should be about shoulder length apart
5. pick up the bar -- you can lean slightly back and should feel the weight on your heels or mid-foot
   but not on your toes
6. stand up -- use your lower body to drive up, your arms should not be pulling
7. once fully up, start the descent
8. always keep your shoulders back and down, never round your back during the descent
9. the first part of the descent should start with bending your knees slightly
10. then lean forward, sticking your butt/hip out slowly to lower the bar
11. the bar should be touching your thigh the entire time
12. once the bar reaches your knee, the deadlift turns into more of a squat
13. at this point, stick your butt/hips out more and bend knees to lower the bar to the ground
14. the bar should follow a vertical/linear path the entire time (when viewed from the side)

# Squat

Steps:

1. start with one foot forward, underneath the barbell. Walk underneath and place the barbell on
   top of your back. Place the other foot forward now.
2. stand up and take a step backwards
3. feet should be a little more than shoulder length apart, toes slightly pointed outwards
4. pinky fingers should be touching the ring markers on the barbells (can be adjusted for personal
   preferences)
5. shoulders back and down, pull down on the bar to tense your core
6. bend your knees and drive your hips backwards, should resemble sitting down
7. weight should be between the ball of your feet and heels (or maybe just heels?)
8. if your knees are collapsing inwards, act like you're ripping apart the floor with your feet to
   prevent them from collapsing
9. once in the down position, your shins should be perpendicular to the floor (your knees should
   never cover your feet from your view up top)
10. the full down position is when your hips are below your knees, drive the bar back up

To practice form, you can place a bench or box behind you. Fall back onto the bench in a sitting
position then sit back up. Make sure your shins are perpendicular to the floor in the sitting
position -- if it's not then sit further back!

Another great way to practice is to use a kettlebell or dumbbell instead. Hold it at chest level
about 6-8 inches in front of you and squat.
