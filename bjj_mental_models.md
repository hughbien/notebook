# BJJ Mental Models

Notes on [BJJ Mental Models](https://bjjmentalmodels.com/database/) by Matt and Steve Kwan.

There are four categories:

* learning - optimize your learning/training
* mechanical - use physics/biomechanics to control your (or your opponent's) body
* social - improve relationships and team dynamics
* strategic - improve decision making process

My started models: 80/20 rule, first principles, habits over results, principles over techniques,
core mechanics, elbow-knee connection, force compression, theory of alignment, feedback loop,
alignment over position, controlling the distance, kuzushi, microtransitions, technique chaining.

# Learning Models

**80/20 Rule** -
80% of the results come from 20% of the effort. Also known as Pareto Principle. Applied to BJJ:
which areas of our game can get the most results? This should be used to create a gameplan/strategy
for mental models, positions, submissions, and training.

**Abundance Mindset** -
Someone else's success does not mean your failure. It's not zero-sum. Learn to be happy for other
people. Their gain does not necessarily mean your loss.

**Beginner's Mind** -
To maximize learning, listen/talk/act like a beginner. Ego prevents our ability to learn. Experience
tends to lead to ego. Everybody has something to teach you.

**Cognitive Load** -
Your brain struggles to learn when it runs out of working memory. Reduce cognitive load to make it
easier to learn. Reduce by chunking, keeping objectives clear/concise, remembering most important
details, staying focused.

**Consistency** -
Take a step every day to improve your Jiu-Jitsu, even if that step is small. Consistency is more
important than intensity. Make it a daily routine. If you can't train, you can: watch a video,
study footage, or write in a journal. 4-7 times per week is recommended. Prioritize consistency
over total hours trained.

**Defensive Thinking** -
Focus on succeeding rather than avoiding failure. Defensive thinking is when someone prioritizes
avoiding loss instead of achieving victory. Don't avoid competing if you're afraid of loss, don't
avoid rolls with people better than you, don't stay a gym because it's too comfortable if you've
stopped learning.

**First Principles** -
Break down complex ideas into fundamental concepts that stand alone, then build them back up again.
First principles are atomic, universally true statements. To apply to BJJ: choose a technique/concept,
break it down to first principles, identify any conflicts, identify any new first principles, rebuild
the technique from the ground up via composition of principles, visualize patterns between other
techniques/concepts.

**Flow** -
Create triggers and routines to help you get into "the zone." Examples include: breathing meditation,
listening to a song before a competition, putting on the Gi.

**Form to Leave Form** -
Drill techniques until they move from your conscious mind to your muscle memory. Once it's a part
of your muscle memory, you don't need to think or recall each step/detail, it becomes a single
concept and building block for future learning.

**Growth From Discomfort** -
Get comfortable being uncomfortable. We tend to stay within our comfort zone, but for growth we'll
need to venture outside of that zone. Try new techniques, positions, harder classes, rolling when
exhausted, bigger/stronger/experienced partners.

**Growth Mindset** -
Don't think of attributes like talent and athleticism as unchangeable. Fixed mindset might think:
"I'm bad at guard" or "He beat me because he's bigger than me". Growth mindset might think: "I need
to work on my guard" or "What are the best strategies against a larger opponent?".

**Habits Over Results** -
The best way to achieve long-term results is to build and maintain short-term habits. Prioritize
habits over results. Identify keystone habits. Create daily/weekly/monthly checklists. Make an
accountability system.

**Incremental Learning** -
You won't fully learn a technique in one attempt. Revisit a technique over time to add in the
details you weren't ready for earlier. Every technique is made of: principles, details, variations,
and defenses. Start with principles, fill in the details over time.

**Interleaving** -
Study related skills or concepts in parallel. For example, a pianist alternatives practice between
scales/chords/arpeggios or a tennis player alternatives between forehands/backhands/volleys.

**Investing in Loss** -
If you want to get good at something, you need to spend a lot of time being bad at it. View loss as
an investment, rather than something to avoid. Don't avoid the areas you're likely to lose in, doing
so will prevent growth.

**Kaizen** -
Kaizen is the Japanese concept of continuous improvement: measure and monitor progress, identify
areas where you can improve, focus on improving those areas. Dedicate thoughts to Kaizen with each
training session.

**Learning Styles** -
Know which learning style works best for you, and utilize multiple learning styles for best results:
visual, audio, kinetic (by moving/doing), deductive (by thinking things through).

**Loss Aversion** -
We feel losses as more painful than equivalent gains, so we tend to avoid situations where losses
could occur. Related to Investing in Loss.

**Making Smaller Circles** -
Master the core fundamentals of a technique before you branch off into the details. Focus on depth
before breadth. When learning a new technique, get a deep understanding of the basic core movements
first. Then expand to details/variations.

**Meditative Drilling** -
Meditative drilling transfers new techniques into muscle memory, even when you aren't on the mats.
Replay moves over and over again in your mind. Mental drilling makes it easier to recall.

**Mindfulness** -
Train your attention on the present moment. Develop awareness of thoughts and feelings. Identify
self-defeating thoughts and remove them. Realize when you're not breathing and control your breath.
Realize when you're tense and loosen up. Realize when you're too comfortable and make an effort to
get out of the comfort zone.

**Mnemonics** -
Use memory shortcuts, known as mnemonics, to remember complex concepts.

**Naming Concepts** -
Assigning names to complex concepts makes them more memorable. Named concepts are easier to recall,
simplifies discussions, and easier to build on top of. Name them after a person (eg De La Riva guard),
a unique aspect of a technique (triangle choke), or a word that can be associated with the technique
(spider guard).

**Plus, Minus, Equals** -
Train with people better than you, worse than you, and equal to you.  Pluses help take your
performance to the next level. Minuses help you train areas where you lack proficiency and reminds
you how different it is sparring with someone inexperienced. Equals let you test your current skill
level and get realistic feedback.

**Principles Over Techniques** -
Memorize the principles behind techniques, rather than obsessing over step-by-step details. Grappling
involves rapidly alternating between thousands of techniques, with thousands of variations, and
executing them instantly. It's easier to understand principles vs technique details. For example:
back control works by gluing your chest to opponent's back. This principle is better to remember
than thousands of different back take variations.

**Resulting Fallacy** -
Sometimes we win or lose by factors we can't control, regardless of decisions made. Explain your
decisions to a training partner without telling them the outcome, they will give you unbiased feedback.

**Scientific Method** -
Make your decisions objectively, and actively try to break your own ideas. Define the problem/question,
research existing material, form a hypothesis, experiment, analyze and conclude.

**Self-Competition** -
The only person you need to compare yourself against is the person you were yesterday.

**Spaced Repetition** -
Spaced repetition is a technique that greatly improves your memory. Document what you want to
remember, periodically review it, review items that you have difficulty with more frequently, review
items you're successful with less often.

**Train With Purpose** -
Define goals for every training opportunity and plans for achieving them. Be specific so you can act
on them. Change your plans over time.

**Training Handicaps** -
Train without using your strengths to improve your weaknesses. Put yourself in bad positions to
learn escapes, retain your guard without grips, do positional rolling, don't use physical strength.

**Transfer of Learning** -
You can get better at something by learning seemingly unrelated disciplines. There are diminishing
returns to training the same thing over and over again. Sometimes you can learn new concepts from
a different discipline.

# Mechanical Models

**3 Joint Rule** -
Limb control requires you to dominate 2/3 of the joints; submissions require 3/3. Three joins of
an arm: wrist, elbow, shoulder. Three joins of leg: ankle, knee, hip. Immobilizing one joint isn't
enough since the other two can bend and escape. For example, an arm drag controls the wrist and
elbow. The wrist only won't work. An arm bar requires controlling the wrist, elbow, and shoulder
(eg by restricting movement on the far side.)

**Anatomic Hierarchy** -
The human body has six weapons, and the core is the strongest. From strongest to weakest: core,
two legs, two arms, head. Use your mot powerful weapons. Attack your opponent's weakest weapons.

**Body Tethering** -
Be wary of any technique requiring you to tether your body to your opponent's core. If a technique
requires clinging to your opponent, it's risky. This includes: triangles from guard, back mounts
on turtles, etc...

**Breaking Mechanics** -
There are three break types: rotational (eg Kimura), linear (eg armbar), compression (eg calf slicer).
Steps involved in breaking mechanics: isolate a lever by creating grips/wedges, prevent the defense
by breaking opponent's alignment, maximize the leverage, apply overwhelming force.

**Center of Gravity** -
It's easier to sweep your opponent in the direction where they're already leaning. It's easier to
sweep when exploiting their center of gravity. If your opponent's legs are supporting their center
of gravity, it's hard. Choose a sweep that tilts opponents towards their center of gravity. Create
situations where opponent's legs are no longer able to support them.

**Choking Mechanics** -
There are three types of chokes: air chokes compress the windpipe to remove ability to breathe,
blood chokes compress carotid arteries to halt blood circulation, and cranks that torque the neck/spine.
Cranks can result in long term injury and are often illegal. All chokes require breaking opponent's
posture first.

**Controlled Breathing** -
Be mindful of your breathing at all times. Maintain a deliberate, relaxed cadence of breath.

**Core Mechanics** -
All techniques in Jiu-Jitsu are combinations of frames, levers, wedges, clamps, hooks, and posts.
Framing creates a shield with the hard/bony parts of your body. Levers create openings and attacks
on opponent's body. Blocking wedge immobilizes part of opponent's body (eg hand next to hip). Prying
wedge pries open opponent's frame (eg knee cut pass). Clamps tether your body to your opponents.
Hooks are made with the end of your limbs to control opponent. Posts are used to maintain base.

**Critical Control Points** -
For every technique, there are only a handful of control points that really matter. These are the
most crucial controls to make the position work. For the Kimura: 2-on-1 rotational control of
shoulder. For an armbar: lever control on arm and strong wedges on near/far shoulders.

**Direct vs. Proxy Control** -
Control can be either direct (eg. a limb) or proxy (eg. the gi).

**Elbow-Knee Connection** -
Keep your elbows close to your knees. From bottom position, it's useful to prevent your opponent
from passing your guard. From top position, it makes it harder for opponent to establish a hook for
de la Riva or similar guards.

**Force Compression** -
Apply force in rapid, intense bursts. It's more effective when applied quickly. It's also more
efficient. It denies opponent the opportunity to react. Examples: arm drag, collar drag, and grip
breaks.

**Force Vectors** -
Identify the exact angle of incoming force, and meet it or redirect it. This is useful when applying
your frames to meet the force vector at the correct angle.

**Head Position** -
Proper positioning of your head controls the distance, improves posture, and minimizes attack vectors.

**Inside Channel Control** -
Control the "inside channel," or the space between your opponent's arms and legs. Underhooks! You can
practice by pummelling. Some examples of inside channel control: double underhooks while standing,
underhook far side arm while knee cut passing, butterfly guard.

**Kinetic Chains** -
Joints affect each other when in motion, and creating "closed circuits" with your limbs makes them
stronger. Open kinetic chains include waving your hand or swinging your foot in the air. Closed ones
include: connecting arms when framing from bottom side control, defending Kimura by grabbing the gi,
defending the armbar by clasping hands.

**Leading Edges** -
Focus your defense where your opponent is generating the most force. The leading edge is the part of
your opponent's force where the majority of force is applied. If you can defend against it, you can
neutralize most of the force.

**Limb Coiling** -
Keep your limbs coiled close to your core, ready to strike. Keep your chin down with shoulders hunched
up. Keep your elbows pinched tight to core. Keep knees bent and loaded.

**Mirrored Stances** -
Only square your stance if your opponent squares their stance as well.

**Overwhelming Force** -
Use overwhelming force when attacking a limb or joint. The limbs you're attacking with should be
stronger than the limb being attacked. That includes: 2 on 1 arm attacks, attacking arms with legs,
attack neck with arms.

**Ratchet Control** -
Add rotation when controlling a limb to increase effectiveness. Examples: armbar can twist as well
as hyper extend, pulling down a head to break posture can also involve a twist.

**Seated vs. Supine Guards** -
Guards can be either supine (on your back) or seated. Supine guards include closed or DLR. Seated
guards include shin-to-shin or butterfly. Supine guards work well in the gi, because you can establish
grips before falling back.

**Single vs. Double Lever Control** -
Attacking a single lever affords more damage, whereas attacking two levers affords more control.
Examples of single lever: armbars, kimuras, arm drags. When you focus all efforts on a single target,
it's easier for opponent to establish base and rotate out. Double levers emphasize control. You're
making it harder for opponent to rotate. But it'll be difficult to submit from here. Examples
include: triangle choke, head/arm choke, double leg takedown.

**Solid Frames** -
The strongest frames use bone structure and contain few joints that can be collapsed. Arm frames are
better with forearm than hand. Leg frames are better with shins than feet.

**Staying Loose** -
Keep your muscles relaxed, and only tense them to finish an already successful attack. Don't fatigue
your muscles or telegraph your intentions.

**Stress and Recovery** -
Alternate between periods of stress and recovery for maximal growth. Take days off to avoid overtraining.

**Surface Area** -
Apply force using the smallest possible surface area of your body. Examples: knee on belly should
use a single point of the knee instead of the shin, side control should drive force via the shoulder
instead of lying on top like a blanket, omoplata should drive elbow into his back instead of laying
arm flat on back.

**Theory of Alignment** -
Jiu-Jitsu is a game of preserving your posture, structure, and base, while attempting to break your
opponent's. Alignment is made up of posture (positioning of neck/core/spine), structure (use of
limbs), and base (ability to generate/absorb force from ground).

**Types of Guard** -
All guards can be classified as hook-based (butterfly), clamp-based (tethering such as closed
guard), frame-based (keep opponent away like spider guard), or hybrid (DLR guard).

# Social Models

**Cognitive Dissonance** -
When your actions and beliefs aren't aligned, your mind gets uncomfortable and tries to resolve the
discrepancy poorly. Cognitive dissonance is tied to your ego. Become aware when you experience
cognitive dissonance and own the mistake you made, take action to make it right. Don't dig your heels
in when proven wrong. Don't stay at a bad gym, stick to a bad strategy, or justify losses.

**Emotional Contagion** -
Emotions are contagious. Be wary of infecting those around you with negativity. It takes one toxic
person to destroy a team.

**Extreme Ownership** -
Take ownership of all areas of your life, even those that are not your fault or responsibility.

**Feedback Loop** -
Feedback is most effective when provided immediately. To maximize learning: go through feedback
loops as many times as possible, make experiments fast, and receive feedback immediately.

**The Golden Rule** -
Treat others the way you want to be treated. Provide the level of intensity your training partner
is expecting. Be clear on the rules of the roll.

**Idea Communism** -
Rapid leaps in knowledge come from the free sharing of information. Long term, think idea communism.
Short term, think idea capitalism (eg for competitions).

**Keep it Playful** -
Jiu-Jitsu needs to be fun for both you and your training partner. It doesn't mean rolling light. It
means fostering a positive training experience for everyone.

**Levels of Competition** -
People operating at the highest levels aren't just “better;” they structure their lives in a
completely different way. For example, a hobbyist can train BJJ and still have a full-time job. If
a hobbyist wanted to be a high level competitor, they'd have to make BJJ their full-time job. People
who operate at the highest levels must change their lifestyle.

**Psychological Safety** -
Create an environment where thoughts and opinions can be freely shared. Team members should not be
afraid to ask questions. It's okay to admit when you don't understand something.

**Race to the Bottom** -
Avoid the pressure to undervalue your services. This happens when competition is so fierce, the
pressure to cut cost becomes great, and the quality is compromised. This model is more for instructors
to understand their time has value and they should charge accordingly.

**Raise the Level in the Room** -
For senior grapplers, the best way to improve is to help your training partners improve. Help your
training partners learn how to defeat you.

**Rapoport's Rules** -
Understand and respect ideas before you criticize them. Start by attempting to re-express target's
position clearly/vividly. List points of agreement. Mention anything you learned. Only then are you
permitted to rebuttal or have criticism.

**Respect People, Not Positions** -
Treat everyone equally, regardless of their status or authority.

**Respect Your Opponent** -
Failure to respect your opponent often has disastrous consequences. Don't underestimate. Everyone
has something to teach you. Kill your ego.

# Strategic Models

**Alignment Over Position** -
Managing alignment is more important than managing position. Put effort into keeping a strong
alignment (position/structure/base) while breaking your opponent's alignment. Having a stronger
alignment will let you do sweeps/submissions while avoiding being swept/submitted.

**Asymmetric Warfare** -
Prefer strategies that attack your opponent where they are weakest. Seek unfair advantages. If your
opponent has a weakness in his game, exploit it. This is best used against opponents who are bigger,
stronger, or more experienced.

**Committed Techniques** -
When you have multiple options available, favor techniques with a higher chance of retaining position.
Ezekiel chokes from mount are safer than mounted armbars or triangles, since you won't lose your
position if the submission fails.

**Controlling the Distance** -
Take away space when attacking and create space when defending. Top half guard: take space away with
shoulder pressure and underhook. Blocking a guard pass: frame with arms and shrimp to create space.
Bottom open guard defensive: create space by backing out and standing. Bottom open guard offensive:
get underneath opponent and attack his legs.

**Crossing the Center** -
The body is vulnerable when limbs are passed across the center line. The center line is created by
your spine. Try to get your opponent's limbs to cross their center line. Examples: arm drags, leg
drags.

**Defend With Purpose** -
A defense is only a good defense if it gets you out of the bad position. Some stalling defenses
include: hands against neck to prevent chokes, grabbing arms together to prevent armbar.

**Dictate the Pace** -
Be active, not reactive. Senior grapplers tend to make quicker on-the-fly decisions and are able
to keep junior grapplers on the defensive the entire time. Dictate the pace by: being impervious
to your opponent's attacks (strength/size/alignment) or train with enough consistency that you can
execute without thinking.

**Dilemma** -
Force your opponent to choose between two equally bad options. Know predictable responses to a
technique, present opponent with dilemma so they have to choose one, apply counters to those responses
immediately. Examples: triangle/armbar combination, omoplata as sweep/submission, Kimura trap.

**Do What Works** -
If a technique is working for you, it's a good technique regardless of what anyone says. A good
technique means: you can make it work against quality opponents and it does not compromise your
alignment.

**Dominant Angles** -
Create positions where your opponent is not fully facing you, and exploit those angles. In wrestling,
you create angles before shooting takedowns. Set yourself up before attacking.

**Double Trouble** -
To fully control a near side limb, you must also control a far side limb. One of the best ways to
secure an arm/leg attack is by focusing on the other arm/leg. To execute an arm/leg submission:
fully immobilize the limb, prevent partner from rolling out of it by immobilizing the connecting
joint (shoulder/hip), which is best done by immobilizing the torso, which can be done by immobilizing
the far side arm/leg. For armbars: pinch the far shoulder with ankles. Omoplata: control the far
shoulder. Kimura: ground wedges to block movement of far shoulder. Americana: elbow in neck to prevent
rotation.

**Economy of Motion** -
Favor techniques that require minimal movement and energy.

**Funneling** -
Take away options until your opponent is forced to fight you where you're strongest. Identify which
positions yield greatest results and build strategies/transitions that lead your opponent there.

**Grip Inversion** -
The instant your opponent grips you, find a way to invert the grip so you control your opponent.
First person establishing effective grips will dominate the fight. You need to invert control of
the grip (ensure opponent cannot re-grip you), not just break it. Do this by: breaking the grip,
inverting control (circling hand/foot and bringing it inside and re-grip), changing the angle.
Examples: pummeling for underhook or inside grip.

**Grips Dictate Position** -
Whoever controls the grips controls the position.

**Inversion** -
Find creative solutions by attacking problems backward. Examples include: Granby rolls, crab rides,
and berimbolos. In real life: pre-mortems and inverted planning.

**Kuzushi** -
Break your opponent's balance before attempting a throw or sweep. You want to break your opponent's
alignment (posture/structure/base).

**Layers of Guard** -
Like an onion, the guard has many layers. You pass by peeling the layers back one by one. First get
past opponent's legs, then their arms, then stabilize the position after passing.

**Mask Your Intentions** -
Mask your intentions so your opponent doesn't know what you're really attacking. Keep opponent
guessing by presenting multiple attacks they must defend, which will expose openings. Examples:
fake a scissor sweep to catch opponent in a triangle.

**Microtransitions** -
Single techniques rarely work. Success comes from exploiting windows between techniques. "Music is
the space between the notes". In class, we learn one technique at a time. While rolling, your first
attack likely won't work, but it will create openings for a second. Continuous and fluid onslaught
of techniques will create exploitable openings. Focus less on perfectly executing single techniques
and more on fluidly chaining techniques.

**Minimize Attack Vectors** -
Position your body to reduce the places your opponent can attack you. Use a staggered stance,
strong posture in guard, keep arms/legs tucked in.

**Myopia** -
Don't get so caught up in what you want that you ignore better opportunities. It's the technical name
for nearsightedness.

**Path of Least Resistance** -
Go around obstacles rather than through them. If opponent establishes a frame, instead of muscling
through it try going around. This usually means switching angles and establishing a dominant angle.
Instead of plowing through a knee shield, try a backstep or stand up and do an x-pass.

**Phases of Guard** -
Guard has three distinct phases: engagement (contact is made), maintenance (in guard), and retention
(prevent guard from being passed). For engagement, get good grips. For maintenance, maintain
posture/frame/base with your legs and torso. Manage distance. For retention, break down your opponent's
alignment and manage the distance.

**Placeholders** -
Don't abandon one point of control until you've replaced it with another. Don't release a grip until
you've secured another. Think of it like climbing a rope. For knee cuts: you need to control opponent's
arm or torso before passing the leg.

**Position Over Submission** -
Prefer positional advancement and security over submission attempts. Do not attempt submissions
unless you are fully secure in your position. Diving for submissions is like gambling while securing
position is like investing.

**Predictable Responses** -
Each technique has a series of common and predictable reactions. Physiological responses are biological
reactions. If I push you, you'll brace and push back. Trained responses are what we've drilled into
muscle memory. If I triangle you, you'll posture up to defend.

**Prioritize Longevity** -
Be wary of techniques and scenarios that have a high chance of self-injury. Injuries occur during
scrambles or uncontrolled flurries of motion, when you don't understand the position you're in and
you compensate with athleticism. Lack of positional awareness and compensating with explosiveness
means high chance of injury.

**Return on Investment** -
Calculate the risk and possible reward before taking any action. Should you do an armbar from mount
or ezekial choke? One sacrifices the position, the other doesn't.

**Shifting Platforms** -
Continuously move and switch angles to prevent your opponent from applying pressure against you.
If you're not moving, you're a stable platform and your opponent can easily apply force on you. A
shifting platform makes it much harder. Make your movements small with continuous micro movements.
From bottom side control: don't use explosive hip bumps or shrimps that burn energy. Use non-stop
small hip bumps and shrimps, small and continuous. This works in top open guard too by shifting your
hips to change angles.

**Technique Chaining** -
A non-stop series of attacks works a lot better than a single attack. Single attacks in isolation
don't work, but it forces your opponent to react which creates openings.

**Tipping Points** -
Once you have sufficient leverage or momentum, your desired outcome can no longer be denied.

**Win Conditions** -
By knowing and exploiting the rules, you can defeat an otherwise superior opponent who doesn't.
If you're competing, learn the competition rules. Farm points by taking down to guard (so you can
pass), using the knee on belly position, let your opponent re-guard so you can pass.
