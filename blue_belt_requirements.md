# Blue Belt Requirements

Notes on Blue Belt Requirements 2.0 by Roy Dean. There's a huge amount of information in this video,
these notes only cover a tiny subset. I'll aim for two or more techniques per section.

# Falling Skills

**Always tuck your chin!** Don't hit your head.

Forward roll - keep legs wide, one in front of the other, lower your base closer to the ground. 
Extend arm forward that's same side as forward foot, throw it "through" your legs and roll on your
shoulder. Tuck your chin. End up with your legs tucked on one knee. 

Forward break fall - the point of roll is to continue momentum. Break falls end momentum. This works
just like the forward roll above, but ends differently. End on your back, one leg tucked, other leg
spread out on floor, hand hits ground to dissipate impact. Hand hitting ground should be opposite of
tucked leg. One sound is ideal (for all body parts).

Backward roll - drop to knee, fold foot out of the way, roll back, send two arms over one shoulder
that you'll roll over.

Backward break fall - start standing, lower legs. Tuck chin. Roll back and both hands go out and
slap the mat. Legs end up in the air.

Lateral break fall - step out with left leg, sweep out right leg, lower yourself to ground. Fall
onto your sides and hyperextend your arm to slap the mat.

# Movements

**Choose between being a ball or cube.** The ball continues momentum. The cube stops momentum.

Shrimping - start on ground, bridge your hips up until only one foot and shoulders are on mount.
Extend your butt (hip escape) in the same direction as the foot on the ground. Your hands should
start protecting your face, then push down as your shrimp.

# Takedowns

Double Leg - drop down to your knees, putting one knee in between partner's legs. Grab both legs
behind their knees. Use other foot to sweep the leg if necessary. Pull partner's legs, sweep, push
their body with your ear and upper body. You can transition to side mount by putting shoulder pressure
onto your partner once they're on their back.

Double Leg, Partner Sprawls (Turn Counter) - if your partner sprawls, the outside leg should step
and turn while pushing with your upper body.

Single Leg - drop knee his legs, keep inside leg straight, and break posture partner's posture.
Head goes straight into his ribs. Hook leg with outside arm. Stand up and keep foot trapped in both
your legs. Twist and push with your body for takedown.

# Mount Escapes

Trap and roll - bridge and bump partner with knee to get them to drop their hands onto the ground.
Capture one arm with your two arms. Trap partner's feet with your leg on same side. Bridge up and
to the side to end in closed guard. This can be done with an overhook also if partner is in a high
mount.

Foot drag - frame against his hip, bridge to capture his leg with your opposite leg. It's similar
to a shrimp. Frame should be pushing against his hip. After capturing and moving to half guard,
shrimp the opposite side to move into closed guard. Instead of capturing his leg with yours, you can
also use your leg to scoop up.

# Headlock Escapes

Leg scissor - partner has you in headlock on ground. Frame against his jaw/arm. Shrimp out while
pushing him away. Swing leg around his neck and trap his head with your legs.

To armlock - pull on top shoulder while shrimping away, tip until you're on top. Clear legs and
step over. From here you can frame and posture up. From here you have a straight arm bar.

To side control - shrimp away from partner until you throw your leg over his and achieve a hook.
Roll your partner on top of you, then bridge and sweep him into your side control.

# Sidemount Escapes

Classic - setup both arms to frame against partner, one against neck and the other against partner's
hip. Lower forearm against neck. Bridge up, shrimp out away. Insert inner leg in. Outer leg wraps
around his back. Move into closed guard. Ideally control his arm while escaping.

To the knees - similar to the classic escape, but instead of achieving closed guard you attain the
underhook and scissor your legs to get onto your knees. Do this after the bridge up. Grab the rear
leg at knee/ankle and tackle partner down.

# Armlocks from Guard

Basic - cuff wrist and trap partner's tricep. Put foot on hip on same side as armlock. Shrimp and
put other leg up high on his back, locking down. Put other leg over also. Raise hip on trapped arm.
If partner drives his arm into you, you can raise your hips before trapping his arm. Keep everything
tight and in-escapable.

Kimura - break posture and get his hands onto mat, undercut or use a swimming motion on his hands
while pulling down on legs. Let go of your closed guard, one foot on ground, go up and capture
one of the arms with an overhook then grabbing your own wrist. Fall back onto the ground. Shrimp
a few times while pressing down on his back with your leg. Rotate his arm to submit. While submitting,
pull his arm in tight and rotate on your side.

Basic from standing - as he stands up, walk your shoulders back and hook his heel. From there, 
capture an arm and throw your leg over for an arm bar.

# Chokes from Guard

Triangle choke - goal is to have his partner retract one arm. Easiest way to do that is to pull
on one arm so that he pulls it back to his chest. Then put opposite foot on hip and other foot
shoots up above neck. Rotate towards foot extending up, then clamp down and lock legs. Another way
to get arm out of the way is to shrimp and use your knee to push his arm. Note that where your
legs (ankle/back-of-knee) meet should be on same side as his trapped shoulder.

Adjusting the triangle - if your triangle is still loose, you can grab your own shin and put your
foot on his hip. Shrimp so your head goes into the direction of where his trapped hand points.
Then lock legs again. Pull down on your own shin for tighter grip.

Guillotine - open guard, go for a Kimura, but wrap his neck instead. Connect to your own wrist.
Spiral and drop the elbow, puff your chest. Consider going back into full guard and push with your
legs as you lift with your arms.

# Sweeps

Scissor - hold onto his wrist, same side grab his lapel with your opposite arm. Open your guard
and shrimp hip into opposite direction as trapped arm. With your knee across his chest/stomach and
your other leg sweeping, scissor sweep him into mount. If he bases, push his knee with your lower
leg. During the sweep, pull him forward onto your knee, lifting him onto you making him easier to
sweep.

Hip bump - similar to the Kimura, swim to break his arms and pull with your legs to break posture
and have his arms fall to the ground. Open your guard and lift yourself up to get an overhook. Push
off with your other hand and leg. Capture his post and sweep into mount.

# Armlocks from Mount

Spinning armlock - put chest down to prompt reaction of partner pushing you up with arms. Push off
partner and transfer weight to knee, sliding it up right next to his head. Other foot traces in
a circle. Hook wrist and throw your foot over his head. Fall back into an arm bar.

Americana - one palm on his wrist, other palm on elbow. Use your bodyweight to push his arm to the
ground. Slide arm underneath and grab your own wrist. Rear heel should hook his opposite leg. Drag
elbow down while lifting to submit.

# Chokes from Mount

Palm up palm up - open collar, insert hand as deep as you can. Second hand goes underneath. Both
palms up and cross elbows. Drop your head and squeeze elbows to submit.

Palm up palm down - similar but second hand is palm down, gripping the gi on the shoulder as close
as the neck as possible.

# Back Attacks

Rear naked choke - from back control, punch arm straight out, capture neck around crook of your
elbow. Grab your own bicep. Other hand should go on back of his head. Flex arms and shrug your
shoulders to submit.

# Back Escapes

Scoot down - lower your hips and cross arms to prevent choke/seatbelt. Elevate hips and drop
shoulder. Straighten one leg, shift hip over his hips that you just cleared. Drop arms and roll
onto his leg.

Bridge to top arm - control choking arm. Lift arm and bridge to get out of seatbelt. Continue
bridging into the same direction of the choking arm until you can escape. Block him from getting
full mount.

# Guard Passing

Zones of safety: inside the guard, you want to be in one of two positions. Either be upright with
good posture or low with head down, blocking his biceps. Never be in the middle zone.

Over the leg - bind two lapels into one and insert palm pressure on torso to prevent him from
sitting up. Second hand holds down thigh, forearm pressure inside his guard. Shift leg on same
side out, swivel knee out, then foot flat on ground. Other knee goes into tailbone. Push down to
open guard. Move leg out of the way and then over his leg. Other arm pushes down on hip, then
knee slide into side control.

Inside frame - from open guard, place one hand on his hip and the other one on the knee. Push down
with all your weight on your hands. Sprawl out with legs and walk around his leg on the ground.
Once your front leg is beyond his leg, drop it down to block him with your knee. Shift into side
control.
