# Blue Belt Requirements

Notes on Blue Belt Requirements 2.0 by Roy Dean. There's a huge amount of information in this video,
these notes only cover a tiny subset. I'll aim for 2-4 techniques per section.

# Falling Skills

**Always tuck your chin!** Don't hit your head.

Forward roll - keep legs wide, one in front of the other, lower your base closer to the ground. 
Extend arm forward that's same side as forward foot, throw it "through" your legs and roll on your
shoulder. Tuck your chin. End up with your legs tucked on one knee. 

Forward break fall - the point of roll is to continue momentum. Break falls end momentum. This works
just like the forward roll above, but ends differently. End on your back, one leg tucked, other leg
spread out on floor, hand hits ground to dissipate impact. Hand hitting ground should be opposite of
tucked leg. One sound is ideal (for all body parts).

Backward roll - drop to knee, fold foot out of the way, roll back, send two arms over one shoulder
that you'll roll over.

Backward break fall - start standing, lower legs. Tuck chin. Roll back and both hands go out and
slap the mat. Legs end up in the air.

Lateral break fall - step out with left leg, sweep out right leg, lower yourself to ground. Fall
onto your sides and hyperextend your arm to slap the mat.

# Movements

**Choose between being a ball or cube.** The ball continues momentum. The cube stops momentum.

Shrimping - start on ground, bridge your hips up until only one foot and shoulders are on mount.
Extend your butt (hip escape) in the same direction as the foot on the ground. Your hands should
start protecting your face, then push down as your shrimp.

# Takedowns

Double Leg - drop down to your knees, putting one knee in between partner's legs. Grab both legs
behind their knees. Use other foot to sweep the leg if necessary. Pull partner's legs, sweep, push
their body with your ear and upper body. You can transition to side mount by putting shoulder pressure
onto your partner once they're on their back.

Double Leg, Partner Sprawls (Turn Counter) - if your partner sprawls, the outside leg should step
and turn while pushing with your upper body.

Single Leg - drop knee his legs, keep inside leg straight, and break posture partner's posture.
Head goes straight into his ribs. Hook leg with outside arm. Stand up and keep foot trapped in both
your legs. Twist and push with your body for takedown.
