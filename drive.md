# Drive

Notes on [Drive](https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/) by Daniel Pink.

Summary:

* work can be divided into two categories: algorithmic (well-known rules based routines) vs
  heuristic (creative knowledge based work with no set instructions to follow).
* extrinsic motivation via carrot/stick is flawed for heuristic work
* intrinsic motivation relies on three essential pillars (after basic needs are met):
  autonomy, mastery, purpose
* autonomy - freedom to do your work in your own way
* mastery - get better at your craft by entering the state of flow
* purpose - sense of contribution beyond self-interest

# Algorithmic/Extrinsic vs Heuristic/Intrinsic

Algorithmic work has a well defined formula to apply to meet goals. Extrinsic rewards tend to work
well for this sort of work. The old-school carrot/stick approach works well in this case.

Heuristic work requires flexible problem solving inventiveness. Intrinsic rewards work better for
this type of work. Contingent rewards can even have a negative effect -- by limiting
autonomy and hyper focusing on metrics that don't show the whole picture.

Assuming our basic needs are met (physical/psychological safety, finances, health, etc...), we have
three innate elements that drive us: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

How does Open Source Software work? Why do developers want to spend their free-time on making software
with zero extrinsic rewards? Because it touches on all three:

* autonomy - they can work on their own software, at their own pace, using whatever tools/techniques
  they want
* mastery - it helps developers improve in their own craft
* purpose - they're contributing to the open source community

# Autonomy

> Control leads to compliance; autonomy leads to engagement.

We want to direct our own life.

Autonomy means the freedom to pick your own:

* task
* time
* technique
* team

Autonomy does not mean independence. You can work as an interdependent team member and still have
a high degree of autonomy. People want the freedom over what they do, when they do it, and how
they do it. This means trusting people to accomplish their tasks in their own way.

# Mastery

We want to get better at our craft.

Autonomy leads to mastery through constant engagement. When the work slightly falls outside a person's
comfort, it pushes them to get better over time. When the work greatly exceeds the comfort zone,
you get anxiety. When the work greatly falls short, you get boredom. It's important to align projects
that slightly pushes skill levels, for progress and growth.

Challenge yourself, but get it done.

The three rules of mastery:

1. it requires you to recognize your ability. You're not perfect, but you're infinitely improvable.
2. it's a pain that requires effort, deliberate practice, failure, trial and error
3. it has logarithmic growth, you'll never reach it but you'll continually grow (also check out
   Dunning-Kruger effect)

# Purpose

We want to contribute to the world.

Having a clear purpose is a powerful source of intrinsic motivation. How does the work you do,
day-to-day, help contribute to your: teammates, organization, end-users, customers, or the world?
Does it happen through layers of indirection? Such as financial gains which help support your family.

We're naturally inclined to seek purpose, to perform in service of something larger than ourselves.
It's beyond self-interest. It's how we derive meaning from our work.
