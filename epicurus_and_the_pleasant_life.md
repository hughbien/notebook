# Epicurus And The Pleasant Life

Notes on [Epicurus And The Pleasant Life](https://epicurusphilosophy.com) by Haris Dimitriadis.

# Pleasure: The Guide To Life

> Pleasure is the beginning and the end of the happy life.

Epicurus states that pleasure is both the means and purpose of life. Pleasure incorporates all
positive emotions. It's the opposite to pain. It's subjective. It's generally mixed pleasure rather
than pure -- it's mixed with pain. An activity is pleasurable if it provides more pleasure than the
pain it involves. Epicurus wants us to pursue pure pleasure, without being carried away with
pleasure that requires pain.

* pure pleasure -- without pain
* mixed pleasure -- requires pain to achieve
* natural desires -- hard-wired into human beings by nature, meant for good/healthy purposes
* unnatural desires -- destructive towards our natural state
* necessary -- foundational needs of life like health, food, shelter
* unnecessary -- mixed pleasure but are not necessary for continuation of life or painlessness,
  we can live without it

Pursue the natural and necessary pleasures. Enjoy (in moderation) the natural and unnecessary.
Avoid unnecessary pain.

# Natural And Necessary

## Health

Physical and mental health should be pursued as a foundational natural/necessary pleasure. The
highest pleasure is survival. A healthy human needs: food, shelter, safety, friends, altruism, and
knowledge.

## Food

Food for sustaining our lives is sufficient to drive the value of pleasure to its peak level.
Epicurus does not suggest you should confine yourself to a frugal diet when circumstances allow for:

* healthy
* tasteful
* consumed in a pleasant environment
* in the company of friends

## Housing

We have a natural desire to shield ourselves from extremities of nature (cold/rain/heat/sun). We
need shelter to survive. Housing produces one of the highest pleasures.

> The body cries out not to be hungry, not to be thirsty, and not to be cold.

But what about the contemporary views on housing? Does it stray too far from Epicurean views of
simple shelter? Do we need: a specific location, homeownership, safety, aesthetics, comfort, and
so on. It depends on the pain associated to fulfill them. Does it confer to a real utility or an
empty longing inflated by social beliefs/customs?

Unless we have the financial means to purchase the house of our dreams, without risk, it would
be better to avoid the extreme stress of mortgages.

Location and neighborhood is of primary importance in regards to safety, health, and friendship. But
not so much for luxury and status.

## Safety

Safety is an essential need for humans. Safety can be found in a just government, through laws
and social contracts. It can be found in the acquisition of friends. It can be found in the
avoidance of insecurity due to uncertainty of the future.

The vast majority of people avoid risk and prefer safety. Safety refers to physical, psychological,
and financial safety. 

## Friendship

> Of all that wisdom for the fullest happiness of one's entire life, by far the greatest is the
> acquisition of friendship.

Even if we meet the rest of our natural/necessary needs, it's impossible to achieve peace of mind
without friends. Humans are naturally social creatures. It's how we survived, and thrived, as
a species.

Friendly relationships may form due to certain benefits, but can develop into a deeper one via
common perceptions and goals.

Friends meet our needs for safety, financial support, spiritual integrity, sex, companionship, and
enjoyment. Epicurus considers friendship a natural/necessary desire.

Friendships have both quantitative (number of friends, frequency of interaction, duration of
meetings) and qualitative traits. Frequent contact with friends is connected to more social trust,
less stress, and better health. Qualitative relates to the satisfaction provided by the relationship.

## Altruism

The Epicurean view is that people originally create friendships for reciprocal benefit, but
eventually come to appreciate friends for their own sake, irrespective of utility. This development
comes about unconsciously, from habit.

Altruism is natural and necessary good for human happiness. It maximizes one's lifelong pleasures.

We see this in nature, when animals feed/protect their offspring until they are self sufficient.
When animals defense the weak and those in need. Humans aren't different.

Contemporary psychology states that the original motive is to feel pleasure and avoid pain.
Altruistic actions do not produce an instant increase in pleasure. So what's the underlying motive
for altruism?

Humans make altruistic acts not just for the benefit of another, or because of a moralistic code,
but to improve the well-being of the self. There is no such thing as selfless altruism. It is
concealed egoism, a source of natural and necessary pleasure to feel impactful and have purpose.

## Knowledge

Epicurus valued reason to evaluate the soundness of the natural desires that emerge from
sensations/emotions/preconceptions/perceptions. Even if one is healthy, surrounded by friends, they
cannot be happy without knowledge. Information is an innate component of human nature.

> So vehement a love, then, of knowledge and science is innate in us, that no one can doubt that
> the nature of man is drawn to them without being attracted to any external gain.

# Natural And Non-Necessary

These pursuits are not necessary desires, but does add value through variety. Whereas the absence
of necessary desires will result in pain, the absence of non-necessary desires will not. These
items are luxuries, albeit natural. Epicurus suggests we pursue them, in moderation, as long as it
does not create more pain than the pleasure derived from it.

## Sex

Sexuality is the most enjoyable experience after water and food. The desire is so powerful, that it
can absorb energy from other necessary human needs. It can be enjoyable if we are willing to take
control of it, to cultivate, and give depth/complexity to it.

While sexual desires are required for the survival of the human species, it's not required for
the survival of the individual.

Epicurean views that sexual intercourse is natural but unnecessary, whereas falling passionately
in love is both nonnatural and unnecessary.

> The Epicureans do not suffer the wise man to fall in love

Passionate love fills life with intense longing and anguish.

Multiple pieces of research correlate health and sexual activity. It lowers dangers of prostate
cancer in men. Regular sex boosts the immune system, lowers blood pressure, increases tolerance
to colds/flu, and relieves stress.

## Family

Epicurus' view on family reflects the circumstances of his era, that having a family was difficult.
If conditions were favorable, he might have concluded otherwise.

Either have a family or have good friends. He counts family members as potential friends.
In Epicurus' view, common friendship is more advantageous than family friendship because it has
the same advantages without the costs. His attitude was to not have children, but was known to be
loving and caring for the children of his friends.

In contemporary views, children are the source of our greatest joys and sorrows. Parents often talk
about how children provide meaning in their lives, rather than happiness.

## Exercise

> Eating healthily by itself will not keep a man well; he must also have physical exercise.

Exercise and sports are important in obtaining/maintaining bodily/mental health. Exercise is for
everyone. Aged persons who regularly play sports were found to be more optimistic, have lower
blood pressure, and suffer less from anxiety. Frequent exercise helps prevent/treat serious chronic
symptoms like: high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, insomnia, dementia, strokes.
The lack of exercise can cause these issues.

Exercise and sports also increase the serotonin/endorphin levels in the brain, which helps create
a cheerful/active mood. It improves the quality of sleep. It reduces accumulated rage.

Exercise -- just do it.

## The Senses

Epicurus appreciated the senses and recognized they had two roles: ultimate means of truth and
source of intense pleasure. All of our knowledge comes from the senses.

Kinetic phase - the active titillation of the senses. Static - the pleasurable feeling after one's
desires have been satisfied.

> Bread and water confer the highest possible pleasure when they are brought to hungry lips.

> Before you look for something to eat and drink you should look around for companions with whom
> to eat and drink.

Taste - Epicurus appreciated the pleasure of eating/taste, though he viewed taste/smell as
minor compared to vision/hearing.

Touch - massage therapy is a great example of how physical touch can help lift moods and create a
better life. Touch is critical to newborns, babies held regularly grow faster and are healthier.
Touch improves circulatory and lymphatic function, helps fight fatigue, and enhances the body's
immune system.

Vision - enjoy a walk in the garden to see new things, enjoy colorful flowers/plants. See the smile
of a loved one. The world is full of nice things to see.

Hearing - enjoy the voice of a loved one and making conversation. Enjoy music in our ears.

Smell - smells easily trigger memories in our life. Use them to remember the pleasant moments of
the past. Smell a freshly baked apple pie, homemade bread, freshly cut grass.

## Nature

Activities in nature offer pleasures, especially combined with exercise and the senses. Enjoy the
emotions that will range from peace to enthusiasm. Experiencing the wilderness creates a sense of
enchantment, being alive, community, and meaningfulness.

There is a positive link between nature and physical/mental health. It's so strong, it's considered
an effective strategy for better public health.

## Humor, Arts, Aesthetics

Humor/laughter increases the pleasure of being alive. It fulfills a vital function in lives. It
belongs to the field of positive psychology.
