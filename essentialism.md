# Essentialism

Notes on Essentialism by Greg McKeown.

Essentialism is focusing on what really matters to you, executing on that, and eliminating
everything else.

# Essence

What is the core mindset of an Essentialist? This part examines the core tenants of Essentialism.

* Choose - Instead of "I have to", think "I choose to." Don't forget your ability to choose. It's
  your choice, don't give it away to other people.
* Discern - Instead of thinking everything is essential, realize almost everything is nonessential.
  Opportunities are not all equal, learn to discern the vital few from the trivial many.
* Trade-Off - Instead of thinking you can do it all or trying to figure out how to do all, consider
  the trade-offs and ask what can you go big on? Embrace trade-offs to make deliberate, strategic,
  and thoughtful choices.

# Explore

How can we discern the trivial many from the vital few? This part examines how to determine what
to eliminate and what to execute on.

* Escape - Create space to escape and explore life. Give yourself space to concentrate, focus,
  explore, learn, and design your own life.
* Look - Scan for essence instead of being overwhelmed by all the information. Try to find the
  signal in the noise. Make goals/questions explicit. Consider keeping a journal.
* Play - Play is not trivial, it's essential. It sparks exploration and creativity.
* Sleep - Sleep deprivation ruins health and productivity. Sleep puts you at your peak performance.
  It's an investment that breeds creativity. It's a priority that enables mental contribution.
* Select - Hell yeah! Or no. Choose activities that are the best use of your time. Use
  narrow/explicit criteria.

# Eliminate

How can we cut out the trivial many? This part examines tactics to remove tasks from our lives.

* Clarify - Have a concrete/inspirational strategy. As opposed to general/bland. Be conscientious
  with it, it should guide you on how to eliminate decisions.
* Dare - Say "no" firmly, resolutely, and gracefully. Separate the decision from the relationship.
  A clear no is better than a vague/noncommital yes. This enables you to say "yes" to things that
  really matter.
* Uncommit - Beware the sunk-cost bias. If you weren't already invested in a task, how much would
  you invest it in now? What better activity could you be doing now? Get comfortable with cutting
  losses. Stop making casual commitments and pause before you commit.
* Edit - Eliminate the distracting words, images, details. Making things better means subtracting
  too. Editing life means making calculated moves, cutting out things that can cloud the
  message/story.
* Limit - Limits and boundaries are liberating. Set rules in advance to eliminate decision fatigue.
  Create a decision framework.

# Execute

How can we make doing the vital few things almost effortless? This part examines tactics to
complete the essential tasks of our lives.

* Buffer - Build a buffer for unexpected events. Add 50% to your estimates. Practice extreme/early
  preparation.
* Subtract - Remove obstacles to progress more. Be clear about intent, identify the obstacle,
  remove the obstacle, then let the momentum build.
* Progress - Start small, celebrate small acts of progress, and let the effort compound. Can you
  focus on an MVP? How about minimal viable preparation? Don't do everything at once.
* Flow - Design a routine that enshrines the essential to make execution effortless. Make
  essentialism the default. Think about your triggers and rewards.
* Focus - Be focused on the present and enjoy the moment. Don't multitask.
* Be - Live essentially. Apply these ideas to your life.
