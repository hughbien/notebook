# Finding and Funding a Good Life

Notes on [Finding and Funding a Good Life](https://www.pwlcapital.com/finding-and-funding-a-good-life/)
by Ben Felix.

This paper provides an overview of the non-financial considerations, paired with reflective questions,
to help make decisions. There's more to a good life than wealth accumulation and risk-adjusted
returns. It's subjective, but this paper uses research in economics/psychology.

# Circumstances and Adaptation

People overestimate the impact that future events will have on them. We fail to anticipate
unrelated events that influence our thoughts/emotions. We also quickly adapt to new circumstances,
both good and bad -- the hedonic treadmill. We believe we're the person we will be for the rest of
our lives -- but that's not true, we always change. It might be better to focus on how we spend our
time minute-to-minute rather than trying to achieve a perfectly imagined future.

* do you focus on one aspect of a major purchase, have you considered how it will impact your life
  minute-to-minute?
* has a major purchase ever increased your happiness?
* have your values/preferences changed in the last decade? Do you expect them to in the next?

We trade time for money, but there's a point of diminishing returns. Globally, somewhere between
$60k and $95k. There is a satiation point.

* how would your life changed if you earned an extra $1k per month? What would you spend it on?
* would you work an extra 3 hours per day to earn more?
* how much would you need to be paid to give up your favorite leisure activity?

Housing is the largest expense and shelter is a basic human need. Homeowners are not happier than
renters -- controlling for income, housing quality, and health. Owners spend less time on enjoyable
leisure activities, instead spending it working on their homes.

Purchasing a home is an extrinsic goal, like money/fame/image/status. Intrinsic goals like personal
growth, intimacy, community -- people with these goals tend to be happier in general.

* do you believe owning a home will make you happier? Why?
* do you enjoy doing maintenance and repair work?
* what life changes would happen if you switch between renting and owning?

The second largest expense is transportation. Vehicles provide utility. Driving a luxury car sounds fun,
but the experience is nothing special. If purchased as a positional good, it's important to ask who
you're trying to impress.

* how did you feel during your last commute? Would a luxury vehicle change that?
* would you still want your dream car if you lived alone on a desert island?
* would your admiration change for people who drove a more expensive vehicle?

Living in a sunnier location may not impact happiness, but living in nature does. People living near
green space tend to have higher life satisfaction. Walking in nature provides more positive emotions
than walking in a city. It improves mood, reduces stress, and changes perception of time.

* how frequently do you spend time in nature? Could you increase that frequency?
* how far do you live from green space? Could you live closer without introducing a long commute?

Some circumstances cannot be adapted to. Things to avoid include: noise (especially
variable/intermittent), interferences with concentration increases stress, commuting (especially in
traffic), not being in control (autonomy is important). Even little things like control of the plants
in your home can have dramatic effects on happiness. This may be relevant in renting vs buying.

* is there intermittent noise in your environment? Can you remove it?
* do you commute? Can you reduce/eliminate it?
* do you feel in control of your environment?

# Things vs Experiences

Spending on experiences is more impactful to happiness than spending on things. People are happier
when engaged in what they are doing (flow). Reflecting on past experiences enhances mood more than
past material purchases. Experiences shared with other people, especially strong relationships, are
important. One way to beat hedonic adaptation is to make more frequent small experiential purchases
than fewer large material ones. Take a friend out for dinner, sign up for a class, spend on an
engaging hobby, or spend on other people.

* how much happiness did your purchases make you? Are you spending on happiness?
* think about the last dinner with your friend and a major purchase, if you had to let go of the
  memory or purchase -- which would you choose?
* did the last material purchase make your life better?
* are you saving up for a big material purchase? How would you feel if you redirected towards taking
  a friend out for lunch?

# Time vs Money

Both are desirable, finite, scarce, measurable. You make time vs money trade-offs everyday. People
who prioritize time over money are happier, have greater social connection, have a better relationship
with their spouse, and are more likely to choose a job they enjoy. People who prioritize money are less
interpersonally attuned, less prosocial, caring, and warm.

While money can buy time, people with higher incomes feel like they have less time. They overestimate
how much happier they would be with a higher income.

* do you prefer money over time or time over money?
* how much spare time do you have? Spare money?
* do you include the monetary cost of your time in daily time vs money decisions?
* are there unpleasant tasks in your life you can outsource?
* have you gone out of your way to save money recently? Was it worth it?

# Regret

Regret can be divided into 4 categories:

* foundational - failure in foresight, responsibility, and prudence with long-term consequences.
  Small decisions that are immediately enjoyable but have lasting effects due to compounding.
  Examples include: over-spending/under-saving, not exercising, smoking, drinking excessively, not
  eating healthy foods, giving up on education too early.
* boldness - result of playing it safe. Examples include: missed romantic connections, declined
  job opportunities, not starting a business. Long-term, people tend to regret things they failed
  to do more than things they did do. Inaction is less painful short-term, regret more so long-term.
* moral - things we have done that felt wrong. Examples include: hurting people through
  bullying/insults/ghosting, cheating in relationships/school/theft, disloyalty, disrespect.
* connection - relationships that have come undone or remain incomplete. Primary relationships
  (romance/family) are felt more strongly than less socially based ones (work/education).

Prevent future regret by improving your decision quality: widen your options, reality test your
assumptions, attain distance before deciding, prepare to be wrong.

Manage current regret for decisions that have already been made. Reduce by undoing the decision,
justifying the decision, or re-appraising the quality of alternatives. Take an "at least" perspective
or an "even if" perspective.

# A Model for a Good Life

The six building blocks of PERMA are:

* positive emotion - hedonia (feeling good) involves gratitude, savoring small pleasures,
  mindfulness, self-efficacy, the feeling of control, and hope/optimism. Avoid the hedonic treadmill.
* engagement - get into the state of flow, which requires complete concentration. For flow, people
  must know what they have to do moment by moment; and they get immediate feedback; and the activity
  appropriately matches their ability.
* relationships - humans are social beings. It's an evolutionary trait that is the primary reason
  for our survival and flourishing. People with strong ties to friends/family and a commitment to
  spending time with them have the highest levels of well-being.
* meaning - we want purpose in our lives. It involves belonging to and serving something bigger
  than the self. Examples include: being involved with community, family, work, religion, and
  social causes.
* accomplishment - achievement, competence, success, and mastery An extreme example is
  mountaineering which is miserable/dangerous, but an outlet to achieve goals/mastery.
* vitality - eating well, moving regularly, sleeping deeply for physical/mental health. Avoid high
  consumption of red/processed meats, refined grains, sweets, high-fat dairy products, butter. Get
  higher intake of fruits/vegetables.

# Setting Goals

Moving towards a good life involves setting goals. Big financial goals anchor the planning process.

Start with objectives, defining what a good life for yourself is. Effective goals are statements of
a desirable state, not the means to get there, and are abstract. They act as a powerful motivational
tool. Pursuing goals involves the real work. You turn the goal into an action to create challenging,
measurable, actionable, and self-set targets. Meeting targets should not feel like a chore. There
should be intrinsic motivation to pursue it.
