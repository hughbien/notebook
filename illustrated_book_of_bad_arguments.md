# Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments

Notes on an Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments by Ali Almossawi, illustrations by Alejandro Giraldo.

# Argument from Consequences

Example: "Experts agree: cow emissions are killing our planet" -- but if we get rid of our cows, we
would have to walk everywhere, that would be terrible for morale, so cow emissions are NOT killing
our planet.

Arguing from consequences is speaking for/against the truth of a statement by appealing to the
consequences it would have if true/false.

If a proposition leads to a good/bad consequence, it does not mean it is true/false.

This fallacy is a type of red herring, it redirects the discussion away from the original proposition.

# Straw Man

Example: An artist draws a beautiful toucan as ugly. He then shows his painting and criticizes the
toucan's appearance.

To "put up a straw man" is to intentionally caricature a person's argument with the aim of attacking
the caricature rather than the actual argument.

This can be done via misrepresenting, misquoting, misconstruing, or oversimplifying.

A skeptic of Darwinism can say "my opponent is trying to convince you that we are evolved from
chimpanzees, a ludicrous claim." -- misrepresenting the idea is easier than refuting the evidence
for it.

# Appeal to Irrelevant Authority

Appeal to the feeling that others are more knowledgeable, which may or may not be true.

You can appeal to a pertinent/reliable authority. But an argument is more likely to be fallacious
when you appeal to an irrelevant/vague authority who is not an expert on the issue at hand.

A vague authority example: "professors in Germany showed such and such to be true." -- it's a
faceless collective.

# Equivocation

Equivocation exploits the ambiguity of language by changing the meaning of a word to support an
ill-founded conclusion.

Example: "How can you be against faith when you take leaps of faith all the time: investing,
trusting friends, getting engaged?" -- exploiting the word "faith".

# False Dilemma

A false dilemma (or false dichotomy) presents a limited set of two possible categories and assumes
everything in scope must be an element of that set. It forces you to accept one category if you
reject the other one.

Example: "You are either with us or against us." -- why can't I just be neutral?

# Not a Cause for a Cause

Example: At the end of every night and before dawn, a beaver walks to the top of the mountain and
asks the sun to come out and it always does. Therefore, the beaver is responsible for sunrise.

This assumes a cause for an event where no evidence exists. Correlation doesn't equal causation.

# Appeal to Fear

Example: Mr Frog lost the election because Mr Donkey convinced everyone that if Mr Frog became
the school dean, the entire university would be run by frogs.

An argument that plays on the fear of the audience, propositioning a scary future that relies on
rhetoric/threats/lies.

# Hasty Generalization

Example: A squirrel that only eats nuts only sees feed that is circle shaped, therefore he believes
all food is circle shaped.

This happens when one forms a conclusion from a sample size that is too small or too specialized
to be representative.

# Appeal to Ignorance

Assuming a proposition to be true simply because there is no evidence proving that it is false.
The absence of evidence is taken to be evidence.

Example: there is no evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth, therefore UFOs exist.

The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim.

# No True Scotsman

When someone makes a general claim about a group, but is presented with evidence challenging the
claim. Instead of revising their position or contesting the evidence, they dodge the challenge
by redefining the criteria of the group.

For example: "All programmers have no social skills." -- "But John is a programmer and he has
social skills." -- "Yes, but John isn't a TRUE programmer."

# Genetic Fallacy

When an argument is devalued/defended solely because of its origins. An argument's history or
origins of the person making it have no effect on its validity.

Example: "As men/women living in the 21st century, we cannot continue to hold these Bronze Age
beliefs" -- why not? We don't need to dismiss all ideas from the Bronze Age. Some might be good.

# Guilt by Association

Guilt by association discredits an argument for proposing an idea is shared by a socially
demonized individual/group.

Example: "My opponent is calling for a healthcare system that would resemble that of socialist
countries. Clearly, that's unacceptable."

# Affirming the Consequent

The logical rule: `If A then C, A; hence C` -- is valid. But `If A then C, C; hence A` is invalid.

A is the antecedent and C is the consequent.

Example: "If you wear armor, you're a knight. You're wearing armor, therefore you're a knight" is
valid but "If you wear armor, you're a  knight. You're a knight, therefore you must be wearing armor"
is not.

# Appeal to Hypocricy

When an argument is countered by pointing out that it conflicts with the person's past actions
or statements. It's a particular type of ad hominem attack. Just because a person is a hypocrite,
doesn't mean their argument is invalid.

Example: A smoker telling children that smoking is bad for you.

# Slippery Slope

A slipper slope argument attempts to discredit a proposition by arguing that its acceptance will
undoubtedly lead to a sequence of events, one or more of which are undesirable. The events may be
possible, but the argument assumes it's inevitable while providing no evidence.

Example: "We shouldn't allow people uncontrolled access to the internet. Next thing you know,
they'll be frequenting pornographic websites and soon enough our entire moral fabric will disintegrate
and we'll be reduced to animals."

# Appeal to the Bandwagon

Using the fact that many people believe something as evidence, so it must be true.

Example: "All the cool kids use this hair gel; be one of them."

# Ad Hominem

Latin for "to the man". It's an argument that attacks a person rather than the argument he/she
is making, with the intention of diverting the discussion and discrediting their argument.

Example: "You're not a historian, why don't you stick to your own field." -- a person not being an
expert in the subject matter has no impact on the merit of their argument.

# Circular Reasoning

Circular reasoning is where one implicitly/explicitly assumes the conclusion in one or more of the
premisses. A conclusion is blatantly used as a premiss or it is reworded to appear as though it is
a different proposition, when it's not.

Example: "You're wrong because you're not making any sense." or "Because of X therefore X."

# Composition and Division

A fallacy of composition is inferring that, because the parts of a whole have an attribute, the
whole must have that attribute also.

Example: "Each module in this software system has been subjected to a set of unit tests and passed
them all, therefore, when the modules are integrated the software system will not violate any of
the invariants verified by those unit tests"

Conversely, a fallacy of division is inferring that part of a whole must have the same attribute
as the whole itself.

Example: "Our team is unbeatable. Therefore, any one of our players would be able to take on any
players from the other team."
