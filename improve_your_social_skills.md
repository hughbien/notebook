# Improve Your Social Skills

By Daniel Wendler.

This is a practical guide to social skills, that explains the principles of social interactions.

# Foundations

What are your current social strengths? They can be social skills or an attribute such as loyalty.
Evaluate the best relationships in your life. How did they affect your life? Have you tried to
improve int he past? What are your current gaps? What practical areas do you want to improve? What
are your short and long term goals?

Social interaction can be scary. True fear is a good thing, eg your body screaming at you to run
away from a bear. Physical fear is your body activating a fear response even is the threat isn't
real. Social anxiety is physical fear. Normally, failure is not a big deal. Next time you have
anxiety, remind yourself it's only a false physical response. You don't need to fear failure.
 
Manipulation vs True Intimacy - true relationships are built on mutual trust and respect. It can
never be built with deceit. This guide is based on the philosophy that you don't need to change who
you are.

# Body Language

Comfort/Discomfort Body Language - comfort signals are sent when people feel good. Discomfort signals
are the opposite. Use these as signals/clues on how to respond, or as feedback for your social
interactions.

Comfort signals include: leaning in, moving closer, turning to face you. A tilted head, or head rested
on a hand, indicates curiosity or listening intently. One leg tucked underneath is literally getting
into a comfortable position. Smiles and physical touch indicates enjoyment and closeness.

Discomfort signals include: face/neck/leg touching/rubbing (used to calm oneself), withdrawing/blocking
by placing objects in between, leaning away, feet pointed away, interruption hand, or very little eye
contact.

Use these signals in context. When did these signals start in relation to the conversation, your
current environment, or your partner's recent experiences? Maybe it has nothing to do with you, but
instead it was a rough day at work. Maybe change the topic, something more light hearted, to make
your partner more comfortable.

Be aware of your own body language. Give genuine signals to match your feelings.

# Conversation

Conversation flow comes from invitation (art of good questions) and inspiration (heartbeat of a
good conversation).

**Invitation** is when you say something that explicitly lets your partner know it is their turn
to speak.

**Inspiration** is when you say something that makes your partner wants to speak without being
commanded/invited to (unbidden).

Together, they build an enjoyable/comfortable conversation.

Invitation tips:

* communicates very clearly that it is now your partner's turn to talk (eg ask a question)
* gives a strong suggestion for your partner on what to talk about
* example: "what did you do today?"
* ideally relates to something that was already discussed but not essential
* if conversation halts, throw out an invitation to get it rolling again
* open-ended questions make the best invitations
* you can't build an entire conversation out of invitations, it ends up feeling like an interview,
  good flow involves multiple speakers and that's when inspiration comes into play

Asking good questions:

* open-ended like "what did you do this weekend" is usually better than yes/no questions like
  "did you have a good weekend?"
* it shows that you are interested in them
* balance between superficial and intimate questions, depending on your relationship with them --
  eg "do you think it will rain this week?" vs "what's your deepest darkest secret". Superficial
  means you'll learn nothing about them, too intimate makes them uncomfortable
* start superficial, then go slowly more intimate and keep an eye on your partner's comfort level
* progression is over the course of a relationship, not a single conversation
* if you ask intimate questions, you should also share intimate things about yourself

Conversation flow tips:

* when conversations flow smoothly, people feel comfortable to share without invitation
* to create conversational flow -- make your partner comfortable, inspire partner to share
* make a person comfortable by: being friendly, paying attention to body language, give good invitations

Inspiration tips:

* the act of sharing will inspire others to also share too
* an inspiration is much less explicit than an invitation
* inspiration creates a welcoming space where they are encouraged to share but not required to
* "how was your weekend?" is an invitation, but telling a story about your weekend inspires your
  partner to share their weekend story
* inspire to share their curiosity, thoughts, or story
* curiosity -- talk about your curiosity, eg a music artist
* thoughts -- share your thoughts about a common subject
* story -- share a story where they might have a common experience
* the same rules of superficial/intimacy applies here too

Invitation and Inspiration in Harmony -- invitations add guidance/structure and inspiration adds
intimacy/flexibility. You start a conversation with invitations and use inspiration as it progresses.
If the conversation halts, you can get it rolling again with an invitation. Invitations can be used
more when: conversation starts, you don't know the other person well, your partner doesn't know what
to say next. Inspiration can be used more when: your partner has shared something personal,
your partner asked you a personal question, you've gotten to know your partner better. Don't start
with inspiration, because it puts the focus on you. Start with invitations, the focus is on your
partner.

**Either give your partner an explicit invitation to speak or share something to inspire your partner to share.**

Ten tips:

1. for initial conversation, reference social context as first topic (eg at a party, ask how they know the
   party's host -- in a class, ask what they thought of the last test)
2. don't let your mouth move faster than your mind, nobody minds a short delay
3. get other person to share stories instead of facts, eg "where do you work?" vs "what's it like to work there?"
4. don't get stuck in a topic that neither person is interested in
5. if their torso/feet are pointing away, they're probably ready to leave, gracefully bring conversation to a close
6. if asking multiple open-ended questions and getting short responses, they might feel uncomfortable/bored, try
   changing topics or close the conversation
7. give yourself permission to fail
8. if you have social anxiety or self-confidence issues, consider a professional counselor
9. if you're at a loss on what to say, share a story that relate to something earlier in the conversation
10. conversation is a skill that requires practice to get better

# Group Conversation

Open/Closed Groups -- a closed group will not have interest in more people joining. Open groups
don't mind new people joining. The more the merrier. One open person facing the crowd and not busy,
might look alert/excited and ready for someone to come over. Keep an eye on body language and be
ready to gracefully exit if they would rather not talk. If they light up and say hello, keep
chatting. For a pair/trio, check how they face each other. If members are angled away instead of
directly facing each other, they're more likely to be open.

Joining Group Conversations -- can be done using a direct or indirect approach. A direct approach
involves an opening question that relates to question, that is open-ended and engaging. The indirect
approach can be done via including someone you already know, eg a friend already in the circle,
or by mentioning something you overheard.

Group Conversation Flow -- it's best if every person in the conversation feels invited to speak.
Because there are multiple people, inspiration isn't as essential, as there's usually one person who
likes to speak up. Conversation is likely to continue even if you don't inspire anyone. But you can
periodically make invitations to people who haven't spoken much. It's important to notice discomfort
signs though.

# Empathy

Empathy is the art of seeing the world as someone else sees it.

Understanding Yourself -- to empathize with others, you need to learn to empathize with yourself first.
Understand and accept what you're feeling and why you're feeling it. Accept your emotions. It's worth
investing to have a solid and healthy understanding of your own emotions. Think about why you're feeling
that way. What's the cause?

Understanding Others -- always ask "how does this situation appear to the other person?" during
every interaction. It helps to get a better understanding of their actions. Once you look from their
perspective, you can handle the situation better. We have a natural tendency to view things from
our own perspective, it's easier.

Nonverbal Empathy -- when someone is high energy they will act: excited, expressive, loud. Low energy
people will act: reserved, relaxed, quiet. High/low doesn't indicate happy/sad, and a person will
switch between the two. Try to match the energy level of your partner.

# Meeting People

Finding Your Group -- look for groups built around something you love (a shared interest), that
your friends are involved with, that focus on improving people skills, and that meet on a regular
basis. At the end of the day if you enjoy going to a group and feel comfortable, then it's a good
group for you.

Everyday Connections -- a functional connection is a transactional interaction, you're interacting
with a person as a means to an end. Such as ordering coffee. A person-to-person connection happens
when the interaction is more than a means to an end. A friendly question, expressing gratitude,
or offering a warm smile. Next time you order a coffee, try asking "what do you do when you're not
working?"

Person to Person Connections -- realize that some people are not open to connecting (eg they have
headphones on). Avoid interrupting if they are in the middle of an activity. Start conversations
by referencing context (eg if you're at a concert -- ask if they liked the latest album). Be prepared
to exit everyday connections. Make person-to-person connections a part of your everyday life.

# Making Friends

Finding Good Friends -- do I like spending time with this person? Does this person treat me and
others well? Does this person seem like they want to spend time with me? You should focus your
attention on people you give you the best chance to be good friends.

Starting a Friendship -- invite the person to spend time outside the normal context that you see
them. Pick an activity that you both feel comfortable with. Examples include sharing a meal or
getting some coffee together, so you can focus on the conversation in a calm environment. If you
invite someone of the opposite sex to hang out, they might assume you're expressing romantic
interest. This can be awkward. It's best to avoid a misunderstanding by not inviting to "date night"
activities. Or simply saying "Hey, I'd like to be friends" before inviting. As a rule of thumb,
wait until someone has turned down your invitations three times before you conclude they don't want
to hang out with you.

Deepening a New Friendship -- pursue a new friend at a steady rate but not one that is overwhelming.
A good rule of thumb is spending time together at least once a month but no more than once a week.
Base frequency of your invitations on the frequency of their invitations to you. Good friends care
about each other, enjoy spending time together, and give each other freedom to be themselves. Be a
good friend to them.

# How To Support Your Friends

Supporting Friends in the Moment:

* be present - your job is to be with them (not give advice, make them feel better, knowing the
  right thing to say, although each of these can help a bit).
* it's not about you - use stories from your own experience sparingly, only to encourage the other
  person to tell their own stories
* make specific, tangible offers - "wow that sounds rough, do you want to talk about it?" instead of
  "let me know if I can help". Other examples: "do you want to get some coffee? do you want to
  go for a walk? do you want a hug? want to play some video games? can I cook a meal for you? do
  you want to tell me about the person you lost?"
* offer support, not solutions - they need you to listen, not to fix it
* don't tell them what to feel - give them space to process their feelings, ask gentle questions,
  and listen attentively
* don't minimize the problem - if it feels like a big deal to them, treat it like a big deal
* don't change the subject - you make a difference just by listening, being curious, and supportive
* don't panic - be calm and help them get better

Supporting Friend Long Term:

* follow up - remember to check in occasionally 
* don't insist - you can make a situation worse by insisting on helping
* educate yourself - remember to suspend judgement, your friend is the expert on their own struggle
* suggest professional help

Taking Care of Yourself:

* let your friends support you - both people give and receive
* don't solve their problems for them
* make sure they want to get better
* practice self care

# Dating

Healthy Relationships -- a healthy relationship has freedom, acceptance, meaningful lives outside the
relationship, and shared selflessness. You should never need to hide part of yourself to be accepted
by your partner. Both partners are equal members of the relationship. Both partners make it their goal
for their partner to be happy and fulfilled.

Beginning a Romance -- when you go to an event with the intended purpose of meeting a romantic partner,
you're more likely to meet a bad fit. True attraction takes time to build. Shake up your routine
and pursue deep connections.

Moving Beyond Friendship -- gauge their interest by comparing the way they interact with you vs the
way they interact with others of your gender. Signal your interest, invite them to something that
feels like a traditional date.

# How To Be A Good Storyteller

Holding Interest:

* start with a hook - give people a sense of what the story is about so they don't get lost
* have a point to the story - answer "why would my audience want to hear this story?" first
* choose the right time to tell the story - don't interrupt another person's story, make sure the
  story fits the mood of the conversation, and it's relatable
* show; don't tell - show only scenes/details that matter
* use vivid details, not a lot of facts - details are surprising, relate to the story, and help
  to imagine the scene
* practice related skills

Building Connections:

* tell personal stories, but cautiously - if it's important to you it's probably interesting
* share firsthand thoughts/feelings - explain what you were feeling and thinking about in the moment

Satisfying Conclusion:

* when you get to the end, stop
* don't forget to pass the spotlight
* application/practice - best place for practice is by writing the stories down, then telling the
  stories in conversation, and it requires consistency over time
