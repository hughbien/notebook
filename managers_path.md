# Manager's Path

Notes on [The Manager's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/)
by Camille Fournier.

These notes are mostly for individual contributors, on how to lead/mentor and how to make life easier
for your manager.

# Management 101

1:1 Meetings - allow for human connection. Great managers will notice your energy level. They will
treat you like a human being, with a life outside of work. It's an opportunity to speak privately.
Don't treat it as a status update. Talk about career/team/company goals, problems and potential
solutions, and ask for feedback. Use this time to figure out what you need to learn and how to
grow.

Feedback and Guidance - managers will let you know how you can do better and when you've made a
mistake. Praise should be public, criticism should be private. Ask your manager for advice. He/she
is your number one ally. The more senior you become, the less feedback you'll get, and the more you
should drive your 1:1s. For very difficult people situations, your manager will help you navigate.

Training and Career Growth - get advice from your manager for help finding training/conferences/books.
Your manager should help you find stretch projects, projects that you can confidently complete but
will grow your skills/career. Your manager will help advocate your promotions, but cannot guarantee
it.

Your Responsibility - you're responsible for yourself. Spend time thinking about what you want. You
can ask for your manager's advice, but it's up to you to implement. If you are persistently unhappy,
speak up and find a solution with your manager.

Manager's Responsibility - your manager will help guide and advise you. But his/her ultimate
responsibility is for the team and company.

# Mentoring

Listen - listen first, it's a precursor to empathy. Pay attention to your behavior when you listen.
Repeat what your mentee says, let them correct any misunderstandings. Communicate clearly what's
expected and what's planned.

Onboarding - effective teams should have onboarding documents. Part of onboarding is introducing
the new teammate and getting him/her up to speed quickly. It also involves introducing him/her to
your network.

Mentors - don't do it unless it will be rewarding for both people. It's better to say no than to
say yes and fail. Practice the art of teaching. Learn how to nurture/coach, how to phrase things
so others will listen. Don't just shout/instruct and expect others to follow. Be curious and open
minded. You'll learn from your mentee too. Listen and speak your mentee's language. Make connections.

Mentee - come prepared to mentoring sessions. Think beforehand what your goals are for this
relationship. If you can't determine what you need, maybe you need a friend/therapist/coach.

# Tech Lead

The Tech Lead role lacks a common definition across companies. But there are some shared traits:
it's almost always both a technical and leadership role. It involves being a strong technical
project manager. It requires delegation, focusing on team productivity/impact, making
technical/product/people decisions. It involves breaking down a project. It's usually a temporal
role and involves at least 30% coding.

Tech leads have different archetypes:

* Systems Architect - you know the architecture/systems and can confidently make technical decisions
  to move the project forward.
* Project Planner - you can breakdown a large/complex project into bite-sized deliverables. You're
  fine-tuning the team's process to be more efficient, getting work done in parallel.
* Team Leader - write code, communicate challenges, and delegate.

To be a great tech lead:

* have deep knowledge of the architecture
* be a team player - delegate interesting/complex work (don't hog it all!)
* lead technical decisions (sometimes) - determine which decisions should be made by you, the
  developer implementing it, or the team
* communicate - the team's productivity is more important than yours. You represent the team.
  Communicate to stakeholders, communicate to your team, make sure everyone has the information
  they need to be unblocked. Communicate via reading/writing, speaking/listening, and note taking.
* balance - learn how to balance your technical contributions with your team's productivity, don't
  let your calendar be overtaken by meetings, help other stakeholders like your boss/product manager,
  and respect the team's focus.

Being a tech lead means influencing without authority. Figure out how to empower your team. Figure
out how to remove obstacles that are blocking them.

The value in planning is executing the plan perfectly and catching all little details. It's to
enforce self-discipline to think about the project in depth before diving in. Take time to explain
basics/motivations. Take time to educate.

How to manage a project:

1. break down the work - break down big deliverables into tasks
2. push through details/unknowns - work through unknowns until you feel you can't add anymore value
3. run the project and adjust as you go - it won't go according to plan, you'll need to adjust
4. use insights gained to manage requirement changes
5. revisit details as you near the end - do a premortem (run through all things that could fail),
   make a launch plan, make a rollback plan

Don't be a process czar. There is no one true process that will solve all problems. Don't obsessively
seek out the right tool to plan, focus, manage time, and prioritize. It doesn't exist. Don't play
the rule cop. Instead get the high level processes right - communication, leadership, technical
architecture/decisions.

# Managing People

Tasks for managing people:

* take on a new direct report
* hold regular 1:1s
* give feedback on career growth and progression towards goals
* give suggestions on areas for improvement
* give praise
* work with report to identify areas for learning/growth and help them via projects/training/mentoring

Tips for managing people:

* have regular 1:1s, adjust the frequency to cater to each person individually
* build trust/rapport by getting to know each other
* make a 30/60/90 day plan with basic goals
* encourage participation by updating new hire and onboarding docs
* communicate working style/expectations on both sides
* get feedback from new hire

1:1 styles:

* to-do list meeting - one or both people comes with an agenda up for discussion
* catch up - let your report drive the meeting, used as creative discussion
* feedback - talk about progress towards goals, give corrective feedback
* rapport building - get to know your report as a human being

Create a culture of continuous feedback. Get to know your reports (goals/strengths/weaknesses).
Observe and identify talents/strengths. Provide lightweight but regular feedback. Praise them but
make suggestions on how they could do even better.

Tips for performance reviews:

* schedule enough time to do it
* use concrete examples - be as specific as possible
* spend a lot of time on strengths, celebrate achievements, give praise of good work
* keep it focused for areas of improvement, have very specific/concrete feedback
* avoid surprises
* schedule time to discuss the review

# Managing a Team

As an engineering manager, supporting people is more important than delivery via technical knowledge.
You should know enough technically to get the team's respect -- so just enough for technical
credibility.

Fournier recommends staying in the code so you don't become technically obsolete. This means picking
up small tasks and bug fixes -- to keep your technical abilities up to date without blocking the
team. You should also know the system well, so you can answer stakeholders' questions.

Some tips:

* balance pushing and holding back - if people are happy and shipping, it may be best to not be pushy.
* drama - poor behavior must change, use clear examples, and provide corrective feedback
* overwork - instability of production means you need to slow down the product roadmap to focus
  on system stability. For time-crunches, be the cheerleader and help out with IC work. Be
  appreciative, offer breaks, and learn how to avoid it next time.
* collaborate - touch base with key people. Get actionable feedback.
* create a data-driven culture
* develop customer empathy
* work on the roadmap - spend time thinking about technical developments
* review outcome of decisions/projects
* run retrospectives
* don't rely exclusively on consensus/voting - take responsibility and deliver bad news yourself
* setup clear processes to depersonalise decisions
* don't avoid simmering issues - conflict avoidance is bad
* address issues without drama
* be kind

Team cohesion is important. A cohesive team makes jokes together, gets lunch, shares coffee, and
are friendly. They're not anonymous cogs. Friendlier/happier teams produce better results.

# Bootstrapping Culture

Structure/processes allows scaling. Startups tend to believe that these slow down large companies.
But structure provides learning. Process provides transparency. We learn from our successes/failures
and encode them in a transparent way. What do you care about? How can you scale that knowledge?

An early startup is like driving a car. You'll grow to become a commercial flight. Then you become
a spaceship, where you can no longer make quick moves and you must plan the course way ahead of
time. At each stage, you can go further and take more people along for the ride -- even it requires
more process/structure.

Learn from failures - examine failures to decide what structure needs to be added. Use failures to
guide the evolution. Success is a poor teacher.

Culture is how things get done, without people having to think about it. Consciously guide the
team's culture. Define your culture. Use your company values and map them into your team values.

Create a career ladder - get participation from your team. Be detailed, with examples. Consider
how it relates to salary. Provide early opportunities for advancement. Use narrow salary bands for
early career stages. Use wide bands when you have fewer levels. Recognize achievement. Evolve
over time.

Depersonalise decision making. For code reviews:

* be clear about expectations
* use a linter for style issues
* keep an eye o the backlog

For postmortems:

* don't create a culture of blame, don't point fingers
* look for circumstances around the incident
* be realistic about which takeaways are important and which to drop
