# Meditations

Scattered notes on Meditations, a journal by Marcus Aurelius.

The original title of Meditations was To Himself. It wasn't written as a guide to Stoicism, but
a daily journal as a way to practice it. It wasn't written for an audience, but for self-betterment.

These notes are taken from the book, audiobook, and several summaries found on the web.

# Recurring Themes

Some recurring and important themes from his journal, that we should strive to think about:

* impermanence - your time on Earth is limited. Focus on your goals instead of superfluous activities.
* fatalism - some things are out of our control. Accept it and move on. Focus on what you can do.
* mindfulness - be attentive to the present moment, your emotions, your thoughts, and your behavior.
* objectiveness - you have the power to change your own viewpoint and be happier.
* virtue - the Greeks believed virtue was living your purpose in life, usually by contributing to
  society. The Romans believed virtue was living without negative emotions.

"Memento Mori" is Latin for "remember that you must die". It's an object - such as a skull - or a
daily practice to remember your impermanence on Earth. It's meant to re-focus your goals and actions.

"Amor Fati" is Latin for "love of one's fate". It's an attitude to perceive everything that has
happened in your life, including the suffering, as good or at least necessary.

# Techniques of a Stoic

Some actions and habits you can take:

* simplify - avoid excess, don't chase a hedonistic lifestyle
* meditate - think about your emotions/actions daily. Journal about it
* practice gratitude - remind yourself of how lucky you are for what you have
* practice negative visualization - remind yourself of how things could be worse
* do good - contribute to society. How can you contribute to humankind?

# You'll be dead soon

> Death overshadows you. While you're alive and able - be good.

You have a limited time on Earth. Reminding yourself of death gives you focus and clarity. Meditate
on that daily. Figure out what's important to you and do it.

# Do less

> Very soon you will be dead; but even yet you are not single-minded.

> This brings the contentment that comes of doing a few things and down them well.

The Greek stoics believed living with Virtue meant one thing: to do your job. What is your calling
here on Earth? What were you designed to do? Focus on that.

Always ask "is this superfluous?". Cut the unnecessary things out of our lives.

# Rise for the work of man

> At day's first light have in readiness, against discinclination to leave your bed, the thought
> that "I am rising for the work of man." Must I grumble at setting out to do  what I was born for,
> and for the sake of which I have been brought into the world?

> A man's true delight is to do the things he was made for.

Stoics believed our calling in life was to contribute to humankind. We are social beings meant to
help one another.

So instead of laying in bed all day - or living a hedonistic lifestyle - get up and make your
contribution.

# Stop caring what people think, focus on your own goals

> Do not waste what remains of your life in speculating about your neighbors.
> Anything that distracts you from fidelity to the Ruler within you - means a loss of opportunity
> for some other task.

Other people have their own goals and priorities. Don't waste time comparing yourself to them.
Don't waste time feeling bad on social media. Don't waste time admiring fancy vacations, cars,
gadgets. Don't waste time seeking approval or thinking about what others think of you.

What is your calling? Whether it's creating art, raising a family, or mastering a profitable craft
-- focus on that instead.

# Be kind and do good

> Man is born for deeds of kindness; and when he has done a kindly action, or otherwise served
> the common welfare, he has done what he was made for, and has received his quittance.

We were designed to do good in this world. Make your contribution to the world.

# Be grateful

> Do not indulge in dreams of having what you have not, but reckon up the chief of the blessings
> you do possess, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.

Happiness is not getting what you want. It's being grateful for what you already have.

# Your happiness is based on your own viewpoint

> Life is but what you deem it.

There are sad millionaires, who feel like a failure comparing themselves to billionaires. There are
happy people who are poor in money, but rich in family and friends.

Re-adjust your viewpoint to be happier.

# Harm from others can be interpreted to be harmless

> If I do not view the thing as an evil, I take no hurt.

When people try to insult or harm us, it's not the insult that hurts. It's our interpretation that
hurts. You can interpret it as irrelevant.

Do not be upset by the misdeeds of others. Correct it if possible. If not, accept it and move on.

Don't let yourself become jaded or change your own principles.

This applies to harm from all external sources, not just people. Whatever pain you're facing:
accept it and move on without complaining.

# Life is too short to waste time complaining

> Is your cucumber bitter? Throw it away. That is enough.

If you have a problem in your life: do you focus on how you were wronged, or do you take action and
fix it? If you hate your job: do you complain about it daily, or do you make and execute a plan to
transition jobs? If someone annoys you: do you think about it daily, or do you cut contact with them?

# Be happy under any circumstance

You often hear the grass is greener on the other side. But the truth is the grass is greener wherever
you water it.

You're the master of your own destiny. Instead of complaining about your circumstances (where you
currently live, what you currently have) - focus on what actions you can do to change your life.

# Fame and desires aren't worth chasing

> When you've done well and another has benefited by it, why like a fool do you look for a third
> thing on top -- credi for the good deed or a favor in return?

You're going to die. Fame and riches will always fade into oblivion. Instead of chasing thanks or
recognition, just do your job.

# Your greatest asset is your mind

Our ability to reason is what sets us apart. It's important to use it to the fullest. Use it to
make your contribution to society. Use it to redirect hurtful comments from others. Use it to always
be grateful with your current set of circumstances.
