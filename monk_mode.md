# Monk Mode

Monk Mode is a period of time where you can increase your own quality. This is achieved by
sacrificing junk activities and filling up your schedule with self-improving habits. This is when
you fine-tune your focus, calibrate your direction, and confront yourself.

The results of Monk Mode should be:

1. a better sense of direction for life
2. growth in your specific goals
3. increased self confidence

Junk activities have no long term benefits. They're just for instant gratification. They may be
necessary to relax after long periods of hard work, but too much leads to a life of regret and
failure. Some example "junk activities" to sacrifice:

* going out for coffee
* sitting idly on the couch
* video games
* Netflix marathons
* viewing Instagram/Facebook
* browsing Reddit
* social outings
* time spent on hangovers

Even after Monk Mode, you'll want to minimize these distractions. Don't rob yourself of growth
opportunities. After Monk Mode, always remember to retain your newly formed good habits.

The core of Monk Mode is: introspection, isolation, and improvement.

## Introspection

Evaluate yourself by:

1. identifying your weaknesses
2. acknowledge and accept them
3. plan on how to address them -- either by fixing or minimizing

Determine what kind of person you want to be and how to get there. This is where you can calibrate
your direction in life and lay out the initial steps. It's important to be honest with yourself --
be specific to your own goals and not other people's expectations.

## Isolation

Solitude is ideal for achieving high growth. Social obligations will overwhelm you during Monk Mode.
Social politics will also influence your goals, making them less genuine to yourself. Without social
obligations and outside opinion, you're free to forge yourself exactly how you see fit.

You can still seek aid in your goals though. For example a personal trainer for physical goals or
trusted advisors for business goals. But nobody else should dictate what your goals are -- such as
your parents.

Isolation from social and junk activities also gives you the benefit of filling your schedule with
more effective and efficient, self-improving activities.

## Improvement

See [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) to
determine your priorities.

Example self-improvement activities include:

* lifting, jogging, or a sport
* cleaning your home
* learn a language
* learn from non-fiction books
* study hard
* learn a martial art 
* learn a musical instrument
* learn to be funny
* learn to cook
* learn to code
* work on your side projects
* learn self-discipline by establishing good habits

Get your foundation in order: physical health, mental health, hygiene, and finances. Invest in
yourself by learning new skills or improving existing ones. Your schedule should be completely
packed with self-improvement activities and habits.
