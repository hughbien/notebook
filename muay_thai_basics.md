# Basic Skills

## Intro

Use your fists, feet, knees, shins, elbows.

Levels of targets are low, middle, and high. Actual targets are forehead, temple, eye, nasal bone,
jaw, chin, back of neck, arm (upper part), chest, floating ribs, abdomen, kidney area, backbone,
leg (upper part), leg (lower part), solar plexus.

Fighting distance is close, medium, or far.

Timing is quick, waiting, countering, or pursuing.

Defensive techniques are countering, evading, blocking, clinching, or maintaining distance.

## Start Position

Stance - in line with shoulder width. Right handers move left foot a little to the front and
turn the right foot by about 45 degrees to the outside. Stay on the ball of the foot. Back heel
slightly higher than front heel.

Guard - keep body in upright position and turn slightly sideways to the front. Lean chin slightly
toward chest. Front hand is eyebrow level and rear hand slightly above jaw. Shoulders kept loose.
Don't lower your guard.

Look - aim your eyes at the central part of opponent's body. In close distance, aim eyes at
head of opponent.

## Steps

Forward - front foot moves forward and rear foot follows along the ground.

Backward - rear foot moves back and front foot follows.

Left - left foot moves left, right foot follows and maintains same angle.

Right - right foot moves right and forward (removes angle), left foot rotates backwards and gets set
in new 45 degree angle.

## Fighting Distance

For individuals of average height, a distance of five feet is usually considered safe where nobody
can attack each other. This is known as safety distance.

Fighting distance is divided into three groups: long, half, and close range.

Long range - use kicks such as forward, side, and jump. You must initially take a step forward.
A suitable way to bridge a long distance or move away is to combine a step with a jab.

Half range - punches, knee kicks, and kicks.

Close range - hooks from the side, uppercuts, and elbows.

# Attacking Techniques

## Intro

Practice techniques slowly and deliberately, without an opponent and without interruption. Kicks
should be practiced at stomach or chest level at first. After several weeks, practice at head level.

Points of targets: temples, forehead, eyes, nasal bone, center of jaw, chin, larynx, collarbone,
sternum, solar plexus, lower rib, unprotected abs, knees. Check with your competition rules to see
which targets are restricted.

Usable parts of you body: fists (always firmly close hand), elbows, shinbones, feet, knees.

## Fist (Chock)

In Muay Thai, legs remain stretched during a punch so attacks can be continued promptly. Do not
lower your height - otherwise you're susceptible to knees to the head. Both shoulder/hips are turned.
If punch makes contact,shift weight to front leg. Protect your chin with raised shoulder. Protect
face with your other hand. Power comes from speed, weight shifting, and turn of hips/shoulders.
Promptly return to starting position. Should be explosive and not pushed.

Types of punches: straight front/rear jab, uppercut, side hook to face/body, overhead, swing.

Straight front jab - started from fight stance, slightly raise heel of rear foot. Deliver front
fist in a direct line. Elbow should be held down as long as possible, otherwise opponent will notice
jab is coming. Rear first remains in starting position above jaw for protection. While punching, turn
hip and shift weight to the front. Shortly before contact, turn fist so palm is facing floor. After
punch, return fist to starting position. Useful main move to disrupt opponent's timing.

Straight rear jab - same as front jab, but using rear fist.

Uppercut - drop one of lower arms and turn fist so lower/upper arm form a right angle. Shift weight
to active side and bend knees slightly. Keep other first up to protect face. Stretch legs, turn body
and hips, shift weight to front. Make contact and return fist to starting position. In contrast to
boxing, knees should not be bent much as it helps opponent execute a knee to the head.

Side hook - raise one fist sideways (so arm is almost parallel to ground), shift weight to active 
side's leg and slightly lean sideways with upper part of body. Carry out lateral punch, turning body
and hips in direction of punch. This can be applied to body too.

Overhead - Similar to side hook, but comes from above. In the process, palm of hand faces the
floor on impact.

Swing - Similar to side hook, but is delivered from a long distance and carried out with a wide
swinging movement. While powerful, it's easy to anticipate. For this reason, it's not used often.

## Elbow (Sok)

Elbows usually require close distance or a quick step forward. Rear elbows require an additional step
forward with the rear foot. Protect your chin with raised shoulder during execution. Free hand
protects your face. Power comes from step, speed, shoulders, and shifting weight.

Types of elbows: rotating, side, uppercut, spear, reverse.

Rotating - raise one elbow sideways until tip is aimed upwards. Hit your target while turning your
body/hips, weight transferred to front feet. Hand of active arm is pulled below the shoulder of
other arm.

Side - raise one arm shoulder high. Deliver arm horizontally to other side, while turning active
side's foot, hips and upper body in same direction. Shift weight to front. This is similar to rotating,
but the arm/fist stays parallel to floor instead of angled upwards.

Uppercut - lower one elbow, shift weight to leg on active side and bend it slightly. Deliver elbow
while retracting hand upwards to your own face, past ear toward the shoulder.

Spear - raise one hand past the ear. Deliver elbow to target from above a 45 degree angle. This
is similar to uppercut, but instead of driving with your whole body this moves mostly your elbow.

Reverse - this is similar to the uppercut, but in reverse. Instead of raising your hand, you lower
it and form a 45 degree elbow.

## Kick (Te)

Kicks are delivered wide from outside, contact made with the shin. Pay attention to inside turn of
the hip. Hands should be kept high for defense. You can also stretch front arm to keep opponent away.

Kicks include: leg kick, round kick to body, high round kick, half shin half knee.

Leg kick - move one leg to outside front and shift weight to it. Apply kick in semi-circle to
target. In the process, turn pivot leg farther to outside and add hip/body weight. Impact is made
with lower end of shinbone.

Round kick to body - similar to above, but aims higher to body. Approach target in semi-circle.
Pivot leg should rest on ball of foot. Deliver as if you're kicking through the object.

High round kick - similar to above, but aims at head.

Half shin half knee kick - slightly retract one leg and deliver it in a bent position toward target.
When hitting target, move hip to the front and slightly lean back upper body. Contact is made with
shinbone and knee. Usually aim for abs.

## Pushing Foot (Teep)

More attention should be paid to a quick delivery than kicking power. Can be carried out with front
or rear leg.

Teeps include: straight front, jab, side.

Straight front kick - pull one knee toward your chest and aim the foot. If you use your rear leg,
turn the rear part of your upper body to the front. Kick with support of your hip toward the
opponent. Turn your pivot leg to the outside and slightly lean back on upper part of your body.
Contact is made with ball of the foot, heel, or entire foot.

Jab - similar to the above but delivered to knee, thigh, or lower leg.

Side - similar to straight front kick, but before making contact you slightly turn on pivot leg.
Only slightly, the body is not completely turned to the back.

## Knee from a Distance (Khow)

Knees are very powerful but have a shorter reach. Holding out one hand will help you determine if
you're within reach. If possible, hold opponent's neck and pull him towards you. Power comes from
take off speed and hips.

Knees include: straight, diagonal.

Straight - deliver knee in direct line toward opponent while raising heel of your pivot leg and
turning pivot leg to outside. On contact, shift hip forwards and lean back upper part of body. If
you want to use your front leg instead, initially move front leg to the back.

Diagonal - try go get a diagonal hold of opponent's neck (eg reach with your left hand to grab
back of opponents neck around right side, pulling him into your left knee). Executed similarly to
straight knee.

## Clinch (Garn Goad Plum Tee Khow)

Knees can be delivered from clinch situations also. A clinch is when athletes are in a close
distance. The weaker athlete will concentrate on moving the hip to the inside, lessening the effect
of kicks.

Basic stance - get as close to opponent as possible. Raise your shoulders and lower your chin
slightly toward your chest. Stay on the balls of the foot. Feet should be about shoulder width
apart, evenly distributed. Stretch body upwards and slightly to the rear. One hand placed on back
of the head. Other hand placed diagonally for pressure. Wrists should touch. Alternatively you can
hold onto your own elbow. Clinch favors fighters who can place grip between opponent's arms (get
the inside control).

To initiate: initially apply a hold around neck with front hand. It's better to get an inside control
if possible. Pull head while moving forwards until you get into basic stance. Consider delivering
a knee while first establishing the clinch.

If you have inside control, you can control the opponent by pulling and pushing prior to a hit.
You can push the neck left/right to unbalance your opponent before delivering knees.

Common mistakes: when initiating only use one hand. Using both leaves you vulnerable. Place hand on
top of other wrist for leverage on pulling opponent's head down. Remain stretched inside up and keep
stance on ball of foot for good posture.

# Defense and Counter Techniques

## Intro

The basis for defense are: faster attack (you carry out a faster counter), dodging, deflection
(such as deflecting a punch to the side), or a block.

## Fist

Straight jab - block opponent's punch with an open rear hand and counter with your own jab. Ensure
you stretch your hitting arm to the front and you shift your weight in opponent's direction.

Alternatively for rear jabs, you can lean back to dodge. You can deflect with the opposite hand to
the inside, while turning the upper part of your body.

Side hooks and swings - these can be deflected by turning the upper part of your body sideways to
deliver an uppercut elbow.

Side hooks and swings to body - these can be blocked with your lower elbow. Turn the part of your
body under attack to the front, so the hook does not make contact at full strength.

## Elbow

Elbows from above or side - can be blocked with opposite arm. In addition, move your block somewhat
forward so elbow doesn't hit with full impact.

## Kick

Kick to inside of leg - retract leg under attack in a semi-circle movement, to dodge it. Optionally
perform a sweeping turn with stretched upper part of body.

Kick to outside of leg - raise your leg under attack to the level of opponent's kick, blocking with
your own shinbone. Quickly return your foot to the ground afterwards. This can be done to protect
your body as well.

As soon as you notice the beginning of a quick, you can take a quick straight step forward and deliver
a jab to counterattack quickly.

## Pushing Foot

Front kick, side kick, back kick - take a step to the rear. Stretch your upper body away. If your
upper body is being aimed at, lean it farther away. Pull chin down towards chest to protect your
larynx.

Front kick and side kick to body - can be deflected. As soon as you notice it's happening, take
a swift step to the outside and deflect kick to the side.

## Knee from a Distance

Straight knee from a distance - take a step with outside foot to the side. Can be countered with
a side hook to head.

## Clinch

Knee kick in clinch - you can carry out your own knee kicks. Or push their kicks to the side with
your own knee.
