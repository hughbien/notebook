# No More Mr Nice Guy

Notes on "No More Mr. Nice Guy" by Dr Robert Glover.

This book shows Nice Guys how to stop seeking approval and start getting what they want in life.

## Nice Guy Syndrome

Nice Guys believe if they are good, giving, and caring, they will in return be happy, loved, and
fulfilled.

This is a myth and the essence of Nice Guy Syndrome.

The problems of a Nice Guy:

* dishonest - hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what people think they want to hear, repress
  feelings, fundamentally dishonest and not genuine
* secretive - too driven to seek approval, will hide everything they think well upset people
* compartmentalized - too easy for them to make excuses for themselves because they're "nice"
* manipulative - often resort to manipulation to have needs met instead of making it their own
  priority
* controlling - constant need to control people to keep things smooth
* give to get - they give with strings attached
* passive aggressive - tend to express resentment indirectly
* difficulty setting boundaries - have a hard time saying "no" and feel like helpless victims
* fail to live up to full potential
* tend to swing back and forth between being nice and not nice

Most people respond negatively to "no more Mr. Nice Guy" thinking the goal is to be a jerk. That's
a false dichotomy. Instead, you want to become **integrated**. The benefits are:

* able to accept all aspects of one's self
* like yourself as you are
* take responsibility for getting your own needs met
* comfortable with your masculinity
* have integrity, do what is right instead of what's convenient
* be clear, direct, expressive of feelings
* be nurturing without care-taking or problem-solving
* set boundaries and don't be afraid to work through conflicts

## Making of a Nice Guy

How does a Nice Guy get made? Usually during childhood. Because he does not feel safe or accepted as
just who he is. The message sent to boys was they must be "good" in order to be loved. When hes was
not good, he was shamed or abandoned. They conclude there must be something defective with them.

This establishes the false rule: if I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to
be, then I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem free life.

Glover also touches on the recent social changes affecting the current generation of men: boys were
separated from their fathers (via divorce, work, etc...) and became disconnected from male role
models. Boys were left to be raised by a school system dominated by women, so they became dependent
on the approval of women. Radical feminism implied that men were bad or unnecessary.

## Learn To Please the Only Person Who Only Matters

By trying to please everyone, Nice Guys often end up please no one -- including themselves.

Nice Guys seek approval from every social situation, but it's most pronounced in relationships
with women. Seeking women's approval gives women the power to set the tone of the relationship,
to define men and determine their worth, and creates passive aggressiveness.

Nice Guys also believe they must hide or distract attention from perceived shortcomings:
forgetfulness, being late, depression, or being in pain.

To fix this:

* identify how you're seeking approval
* take good care of yourself
* give yourself positive affirmation ("I am lovable just as I am", "I am perfectly imperfect", "My
  needs are important", "I can handle it", "It is OK to be human and make mistakes")
* reveal yourself, wholly and truthfully, to safe people
* spend extended periods of times alone -- do things exactly how you want to without seeking the
  approval of others

Answer these questions and be genuine with yourself:

* What do I want?
* What feels right to me?
* What would make me happy?

Take care of yourself, without feeling guilty. Do these things

* exercise or work out
* eat healthy food
* get enough sleep
* relax, play, goof off
* get a massage
* go out with buddies
* get dental work done
* get a physical
* listen to music

## Make Your Needs a Priority

Nice Guys tend to want to appear needless and wantless -- to be low maintenance. This comes from a
fear of abandonment -- if they could eliminate or hide all their needs, then there would be less
chance of people not wanting them.

Don't use **covert contracts** -- where "I will do this for you" so that "you will do this for me",
but nothing is explicitly said.

Don't be caretaking. Be caring instead. Caretaking means giving to others what the giver needs to
give, usually with unconscious strings attached. Caring means giving to others what the receiver
needs, coming from a place of abundance, without stings attached.

The combination of covert contracts and caretaking causes a victim mentality in Nice Guys, where
they start to resent their needs not being met after performing their duties.

Instead, Nice Guys should put themselves first and make their needs a priority. Take responsibility
for your own needs.

For example: the author put himself first by planning out his entire week without full consideration
for his wife. Initially, he had asked his wife what she wanted to do for evenings that week. Instead,
he decided on his own activities: dinner with friends, gym, etc... Then he invited his wife to join
him on his own schedule.

## Reclaim Your Personal Power

Life is not smooth. It's chaotic, filled with unpredictable experiences. Trying to create a
predictable life will end in failure. Nice Guys developed a belief that if they could do everything
right, everything would go right in their own lives.

Realize these behaviors can make you feel like a powerless victim:

* playing it safe
* anticipating and fixing
* trying not to rock the boat
* being charming and helpful
* never being a moment's problem
* using covert contracts
* controlling and manipulating
* caretaking and pleasing
* withholding information
* repressing feelings
* making sure other people don't have hurt feelings
* avoiding problems and difficult situations

Instead, embrace the chaotic nature of life by:

* surrendering (let go of what can't be changed and work on what can be changed)
* dwelling in reality
* expressing feelings
* facing fears
* developing integrity
* setting boundaries

## Reclaim Your Masculinity

It's OK to be a man.

Nice Guys tend to be disconnected from other men and their own masculinity. They tend to be dependent
on the approval of women. They also tend to believe they're better than other men (eg because
they're not controlling/angry/violent and are attentive to a woman's needs). They see masculinity
as a bad thing.

As long as they're disconnected from other men and believe they are better than other men, they're
cutting themselves off from the many benefits of male camaraderie.

Reconnecting with masculinity involves:

* connecting with other men - do guy things with guys like sports, poker nights, volunteering
* getting strong - embrace your body by eating healthy foods, eliminating drugs, and working out
* finding healthy male role models
* reexamining relationship with one's father - how are you similar or different from your father?

## Get the Life You Want

If there were no limits on your life: where would you live? What would you do in your leisure time?
What kind of work would you do? What would your home and surroundings look like?

Now ask yourself: are you creating the life you want? If not, why not?

Be honest with yourself and pursue your own goals instead of living for the expectations and
approval of others. Stop blaming others for your own shortcomings, confront your fears, and live
genuinely.
