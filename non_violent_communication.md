# Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life

by Marshall B. Rosenberg

## Giving from the Heart

* Communication should come from compassion and mutual giving
* NVC has four components: **observations, feelings, needs, requests**
* Emphasizes honesty, empathy, and presence in relationships
* Compassion blossoms naturally when these principles are applied

## Communication That Blocks Compassion

Life-alienating communication:

* Moralistic judgments: labels, blame, criticism -- labels are words/phrases that classify/define
  people in a fixed/judgemental/limiting way (eg lazy)
* Comparisons, which fuel resentment
* Denial of responsibility ("I have to", "You make me feel")
* Demands (imply punishment or guilt)

These patterns disconnect us from empathy and compassion. Use these alternatives instead:

1. moral judgements -> specific observation/feeling/need, "When you didn't share your food, I feel
   frustrated, because I need fairness."
2. comparisons -> focus on your own needs not someone else's standard.
   Instead of "you'll never be as good as your brother", "I want to celebrate my own growth instead
   of comparing it to others."
3. denial of responsibility -> Instead of "You made me feel", "I feel hurt when I heart that, because
   I need respect."
4. demands -> frame it as requests instead of ultimatums and allow space for "no". Instead of
   "You better not...", try "Would you be willing to...?" or "It would meet my need for order if you
   could put the dishes away after eating"

## Observing Without Evaluating

* Separate **observations** from **evaluations**
* When mixed, people hear criticism and resist
* Focus on concrete, time-specific behaviors rather than labels
* Clear observation fosters understanding instead of defensiveness

Describe what your see/hear without adding judgement/labels/interpretations. Instead of "He's lazy",
use "He spent three hours lying on the couch today watching TV." Evaluation mixes judgement, whereas
observations stick to the facts.

## Identifying and Expressing Feelings

* Expressing feelings openly is vital for connection
* Distinguishes true feelings (sad, happy, afraid) from disguised judgments (e.g. "I feel abandoned"
  is an interpretation)
* Encourages building a rich vocabulary of feelings
* Unexpressed emotions cause disconnection and tension

Examples:

* "I feel abandoned" -> "I feel lonely and hurt when I don't get a call back."
* "I feel attacked" -> "I feel scared and defensive when I hear loud criticism."
* "I feel disrespected" -> "I feel angry and disappointed when my ideas are dismissed."
* "I feel grateful when you ask me how my day went."

Key pattern: start with "I feel...", use a true emotion word (sad/glad/hurt/worried/excited), and
avoid mixing judgement.

## Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings

* Feelings stem from **our own needs**, not from others' actions
* We have four choices when hearing negative messages: blame ourselves, blame others, sense our
  own feelings/needs, or sense others' feelings/needs
* Moving from "emotional slavery" to "emotional liberation" means owning responsibility for emotions

## Requesting That Which Would Enrich Life

* Make clear, positive, actionable requests (not vague or negative)
* Requests should be concrete, time-specific, and free from coercion
* Differentiate between requests and demands
* Invites honest feedback and mutual understanding

## Receiving Empathically

* Listening is more than silence: it requires **presence and empathy**
* Hear others' feelings and needs without judgment
* Paraphrase to show understanding
* Stay present even when in pain, offering empathy before problem-solving

## The Power of Empathy

* Empathy heals by allowing vulnerability and connection
* It can defuse anger, violence, and dangerous situations
* Empathy is not agreement, but deep understanding
* Revives stalled conversations, gives space to silence, and enables hearing "no" without rejection

## Connecting Compassionately with Ourselves

* Apply NVC inwardly: self-empathy
* Replace self-judgment with recognition of unmet needs
* Practice mourning and self-forgiveness
* Shift from "have to" to "choose to"
* Live from intrinsic motivation and joy rather than guilt or obligation

## Expressing Anger Fully

* Anger arises from unmet needs, not from others' actions
* Distinguish **stimulus** (what happened) from **cause** (our needs)
* Steps: stop, breathe, identify judgmental thoughts, connect to needs, express needs clearly
* Empathy helps transform anger into constructive dialogue

## The Protective Use of Force

* Force is sometimes necessary to prevent harm, but it must be **protective not punitive**.  
* Punishment backfires, creating resentment.  
* Protective force is temporary, aimed at safeguarding well-being.  
* Emphasizes prevention and awareness of consequences.

## Liberating Ourselves and Counseling Others

* Free ourselves from old cultural conditioning (guilt, duty, domination).  
* Resolve inner conflicts by listening to our needs.  
* Replace diagnoses with compassionate inquiry.  
* Counsel others by helping them connect with their needs, not by fixing them.

## Expressing Appreciation in NVC

* Appreciation is life-serving when focused on needs met and joy received.  
* Three parts: the action observed, the need it fulfilled, and the feeling it generated.  
* Encourages genuine gratitude instead of vague praise.  
* Both giving and receiving appreciation deepen human connection.

## Epilogue

* NVC is more than a communication technique; it is a way of living.  
* By practicing it, we contribute to personal healing, stronger relationships, and a more compassionate world.
