# On Writing Well

On Writing Well by William Zinsser is a craft book that teaches us how to write clearly and
succinctly. Zinsser mentions how important writing is now, we send emails everyday and communicate
messages freely. The word processor made good writers better and bad writers worse. Good writers
would rewrite their sentences, whereas bad writers just kept typing without editing.

# Principles

## The Transaction

Good writing has an aliveness that keeps the reader reading. The writer's enthusiasm of his field
would be evident in his writing.

Zinsser calls this the **Personal Transaction** that's the heart of nonfiction writing. It keeps the
material interesting by using language to achieve clarity and strength.

## Simplicity

Figure out what you're trying to say and write it, clearly. Rewrite. Cut out any fuzz that has
entered your writing. Do this over and over again.

Don't use large words or complicated phrases to sound more important. Use shorter words and
eliminate any element that's not useful.

Zinsser gives us an example of an airline pilot:

> We're presently anticipating experiencing considerable precipitation.

Which could be much more simple:

> We're expecting rain.

## Clutter

Zinsser dedicates another chapter on simplifying. Examples:

* useless prepositions like "free up time" => "free time"
* long words like "facilitate" => "ease" or "implement" => "do
* phrases which add no meaning like "It is interesting to note..."
* phrases which inflate to sound more important like "at this juncture of maturation" => "now"

He suggests that we add brackets around words/phrases which may be dropped from our writing while
leaving our voice intact. Eventually, we'll be able to recognize clutter during the writing step (as
opposed to the editing step).

## Style

Don't garnish your prose. The fundamental rule is: be yourself. Relax and write confidently. We
simplified our writing so your own style can come out. Don't fake it by adding unnecessary
adjectives/phrases to sound authoritative, be genuine.

We're more relaxed when we write in the first person, it's more natural. So Zinsser advises us to
use "I" and "me" and "we" and "us". Don't use "one" or "it is" ("One finds himself..." or "It is
hoped that ...").

Zinsser admits that some writing does not permit "I" such as objective newspaper articles. You can
still convey yourself without using it, just think "I" without actually writing it.

Avoid being vague, commit yourself and stand by your words. President Ford once said "We see nothing
but increasingly brighter clouds every month" because he couldn't commit and say "Things will get
better." Have firm conviction.

## The Audience

"Who am I writing for?" - you're writing for yourself. The writing is for yourself and the reader is
just tagging along.

Zinsser makes a distinction between craft and opinion. It's bad to lose the reader due to sloppy
workmanship, but it's okay for opinions.

Only write what you'd be comfortable saying in person. If you don't normally say "indeed" or
"moreover", don't write it.

From Zinsser:

> "Who am I writing for?" The question that begins this chapter has irked some
> readers. They want me to say "Whom am I writing for?" But I can't bring myself
> to say it. Its just not me.

## Words

Choose your words wisely. Get a dictionary and thesaurus. Avoid cliches, especially overused ones.

Read to learn how to write. Learn by imitating. Don't assume that a published article is a good one.
It could still be sloppy due to time constraints, especially articles in newspapers and magazines.

Readers use sub-vocalization, so be picky about your words and how they sound. Paragraphs with
rhythm are easier to read.

## Usage

Good usage consists of using good words if they already exist to express yourself clearly and
simply.

Zinsser was on a committee to vote for or against new words to be included in the dictionary. A
pattern emerged, be liberal in accepting new words and phrases but conservative in grammar.

It's best to use transparent words instead of being opaque to your readers.

# Methods

## Unity

Unity is the anchor of good writing. Choose and be consistent for:

* pronouns - first/second/third person
* tense - past/present/future, be consistent and only change when necessary
* mood - casual or formal?

Some questions to ask yourself:

* In what capacity am I going to address the reader? Reporter? Provider of information? Average man
  or woman?
* What pronoun and tense am I going to use?
* What style? Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?
* What attitude am I going to take toward the material? Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic?
  Amused?
* How much do I want to cover?
* What one point do I want to make?

Zinsser highlights the last two points. Don't go overboard, pick a subject and stick to it. When
your enthusiasm is lost, your reader notices first.

Make a decision for each unified theme and stick to it. If you discover the wrong choice was made,
edit the initial parts of your writing.

## The Lead and the Ending

The most important sentence in an article is the first one. The most important paragraph is the
first one.

Your lead must capture the reader immediately and force him to keep reading. Next, details must
gradually build up - keep the reader inquisitive. An example lead:

> I've often wondered what goes into a hot dog. Now I know and I wish I didn't.

Look for your lead material everywhere. You may find a great quotation or unexpected fact that works
well to capture the reader's attention. Another approach is to just tell a story, a simple
narrative.

Some other leads:

* In the beginning God created heaven and earth. - the Bible
* Put this puzzle together and you will find milk, cheese and eggs, meat, fish, beans and cereals,
  greens, fruits and root vegetables - foods that contain our essential daily needs. - Joy of
  Cooking
* You know more than you think you do. - Baby and Child Care

The second sentence/paragraph most important is the last one.

Know when to stop. Once you've present all of your facts and opinions, it's time to stop. Don't let
it drag on. The ending should be like a good play's ending. We think we're in the middle of a scene,
then the actor says something outrageous or funny and the lights go out.

A few short sentences is usually enough to end nonfiction writing. Zinsser recommends ending
abruptly and/or with humour. His example:

> "If people come away relating to me as a person," Allen says...
> Judging by the returns, he is. Woody Allen is Mr. Related-To, and he seems a
> good bet to hold the franchise for many years.

> Yet he does have a problem all his own, unshared by, unrelated to, the rest of
> America. "I'm obsessed," he says, "by the fact that my mother genuinely
> resembles Groucho Marx."

## Bits & Pieces

### Verbs

Use active verbs. Only use passive verbs if there's no comfortable way to use an active verb. Active
verbs are stronger and connote more meaning in less words.

    "Joe saw him" vs "He was seen by Joe"

### Adverbs

Most adverbs are unnecessary. Most verbs have specific meanings, adding an adverb is just
repetition.

    "The radio blared loudly" - blared already implies loud
    "... effortlessly easy" - is repetition
    "... clenched his teeth tightly" - you can't clench loosely

### Adjectives

Most adjectives are also unnecessary. Nouns already convey what the writer is trying to describe.

"Brown dirt" is redundant. If you live in an area with "red dirt", that's okay to describe.

Make your adjectives do work that needs to be done. Use adjectives sparsely:

    "He looked at the gray sky and the black clouds..." - dark mood
    "The house was drab..." - not all houses are drab
    "The girl was beautiful..." - not all girls are beautiful

### Little Qualifiers

Good writing is lean and confident. Prune out little qualifiers:

* a bit
* a little
* sort of
* kind of
* rather
* quite
* very
* too
* pretty much
* in a sense

These phrases add clutter to your sentences while taking away your authority.

    "It was rather spectacular" => "It was spectacular"
    "It was very awesome" => "It was awesome"
    "I was quite fortunate" => "I was fortunate"

Don't be kind of bold, be bold.

### Punctuation

* Periods aren't used often enough. Good writing is broken up into short sentences. There is no
  minimum length for a sentence.
* Exclamation points should only be used to achieve a certain effect. These are overused. Instead,
  try arranging your words to put emphasis where needed.
* Semi-colons bring readers to a pause, use it sparingly.
* Dashes are used to split a sentence into two parts. The second part will justify or or amplify the
  first. Two dashes may be used similar to parenthesis, a related thought in the middle of a
  sentence.
* Colon should be used to transition a sentence into a list.

### Mood Changers

Alert the reader as soon as possible when the mood or time changes. Use these words at the beginning
of your sentence:

* But
* Yet
* However
* Nevertheless
* Still
* Instead
* Thus
* Therefore
* Meanwhile
* Now
* Later
* Today
* Subsequently

>  "But he decided to go." works well as a short/clear version of  "Despite the
>  fact that all these dangers were presented to him, he decided to go"

Some words alert readers of time changes:

    "Later I found out why."
    "Now I know better."

### Contractions

Write like you speak. If you normally use a contraction in speech, you should use it in writing. It
will read more naturally.

Zinsser suggests avoiding one form: "I'd", "he'd", "we'd" because they can mean "I had" or "I
would".

### That and Which

Always use "that" unless it makes your meaning ambiguous. "Which" serves for identification:

    Take the shoes that are in the closet.
    Take the shoes, which are in the closet.

It's common to follow a comma with "which" to denote further meaning.

### Concept Nouns

Zinsser recommends using active verbs instead of concept nouns. Examples:

    The common reaction is incredulous laughter.
    Bemused cynicism isn't the only response to the old system.

There are no people in these sentences. The only verb is "is". The reader can't visualize any action
taking place. Use action verbs instead:

    Most people just laugh with disbelief.
    Some people response to the old system by turning cynical.

### Creeping Nounism

Again, Zinsser recommends using active verbs instead of chaining nouns:

    "We have money problem areas" vs "We went broke"
    "We have precipitation activity" vs "It's raining"

### Overstatement

Don't overstate, let the humor sneak up to the reader.

    "The living room looks like an atomic bomb went off."

Obviously an atomic bomb did not go off, don't annoy your reader.

### Credibility

Credibility is fragile. If the reader catches a statement you try to pass off as true, your entire
article/book will be questioned.

### Dictation

Dictated sentences tend to be sloppy, pompous, and redundant. If you must dictate for someone else
to write, make sure you edit your words.

### Writing is Not a Contest

There is no race. Forget any competition and go at your own pace. Your only contest is with
yourself.

### The Subconscious Mind

Your mind is constantly working, even while you're not writing. Take many breaks and let your mind
recover. Find ideas all around you.

### The Quickest Fix

The quickest fix for a sentence is to get rid of it entirely. Don't feel locked into using all of
your writing. If an element isn't working out, get rid of it.

### Paragraphs

Use short paragraphs to put air around your writing. Reading is easier when paragraphs are short.
Newspaper article paragraphs should only be 3 to 4 sentences.

But don't make too many paragraphs too short. Don't make a single paragraph be a single sentence -
which miss a verb. Many newspaper articles do this and it's confusing to read.

### Sexism

One of the problems of writing today is the usage of "he-she" pronouns. Don't construct sentences
which suggest a certain occupation or class can only be male:

> "Early settlers pushed west with their wives and children."

Usages of "he" can be replaced with "he or she". "Him" can be replaced with "him or her".

Using "or" too much quickly becomes burdensome for the writer and reader. Instead, you can pluralize
sentences and use "they" or "their".

One of the benefits of informal writing is you can use "you" and "your" instead of "he" and "his".

### Rewriting

Rewriting is the essence of writing well. Writers never get their first draft perfect. Writing isn't
a product, it's a process.

Zinsser notes that by "rewriting" he means "tidying". He loves to remove clutter, add more
animation, fix hidden mood and time changes.

Review your writing and add brackets to connote where you're confusing the reader, or producing
clutter, or telling the same thing twice.

Learn to love the "Delete" key - remove unnecessary words and sentences.

### Word Processing

Word processors are technology's gift which makes writing (rewriting) much easier. Zinsser used to
explain how to use them in older editions. Now, he has left those instructions out as it's common
knowledge.

Go Vim!

### Trust Your Material

There's nothing more interesting than the truth.

Journalists have a phrase: "Color vs fact". Color dresses their writing to make it seem more
interesting:

>  "Whoosh!  It was incredible..."

Zinsser suggests we avoid the separation of color and fact. Your job is to present the colorful
facts. Lead with interesting facts, don't mix fiction and nonfiction materials.

Avoid the phrases "surprisingly", "predictably", and "of course" which put a value on facts before
readers encounter them.

### Go with Your Interests

No subject is too specialized or too quirky if you can make an honest connection to it. You'll write
better if you're interested in your subject.

# Forms

## Nonfiction as Literature

Follow your own path, whether it leads you to write nonfiction about the world you live in or
fiction.

In this chapter, Zinsser noted how the most popular writing used to be fiction. That all changed in
World War 2, when real life was shown on televisions and America became a fact-minded nation.
Suddenly, the most popular reading material became nonfiction.

Go with your interests. Writing well doesn't depend on the subject, as long as it's interesting to
the writer.

## Writing About People: The Interview

Ask questions, get people talking, and learn interesting facts about their lives.

It may be difficult to write about a subject that you're not passionate about, so include the human
element. Your interviewee will be passionate - show that in your writing.

Prepare for interviews. Bring a pencil and pad. Come with a list of prepared questions, but feel
free to improvise new questions on the spot. Do research on your interviewee. Don't ask questions
which you could have found online. Record good quotes.

When writing your article, don't lead up to a quote with a vapid phrase:

    Mr. Smith said that he liked to "go downtown ..."
    "I usually like to go downtown." Mr Smith said, "and have lunch."

Be careful about how you break quotations. Do it as soon as you naturally can so you don't confuse
the reader.

Don't use confusing pseudo-synonyms for "he said" like "he smiled" or "he grinned". Zinsser suggests
we just stick with "he said" since readers usually gloss over it. If you need variety, use phrases
that carry a shift in attitude like: "he pointed out", "he replied", or "he explained".

Don't fabricate quotes or mislead the reader. When someone gives you an interview, he or she is
trusting you to tell the truth.

## Writing About Places: The Travel Article

Travel writing is difficult. Your material isn't as interesting when you get home. Even it's still
interesting, it may no be interesting at all to the reader if it's too subjective.

Authors tend to overstate for travel articles. Everything is attractive, charming, or romantic.

Zinsser recommends we try to write from a different angle rather than just describing the place. For
example, he went to Mount Rushmore and got quotes from the people working there instead of trying to
describe it himself.

    "...you feel like the 4 men are looking at you, no matter where you move.
     ...making you feel guilty: `Are you doing your part?`"

It's easier to let other people overstate with quotes. Avoid cliches. If you're describing a beach
don't mention how sandy it is or how seagulls are flying over.

For inspiration, read Walden by Thoreau.

## Writing About Yourself: The Memoir

The one subject a writer knows best is him or herself. The most interesting character in a memoir
will be the author.

The difference between an autobiography and memoir is the later is only a window into a life - not
the entire lifetime.

Zinsser recommends reading Walden by Thoreau, again.

You don't need permission to write a memoir. It's the best gift you can give yourself as a writer.

## Science and Technology

Don't be afraid of writing about science and technology. Writing is just thinking on paper. Writing
about science and technology is how scientists record what they know.

One of the tenets of writing is "the reader knows nothing" that especially holds true for science
and technical writing.

Zinsser recommends we think of science writing as an upside down pyramid. Begin with one fact that
the reader must know to continue, then build upon it with more facts. Broaden your writing until you
can begin writing about speculation and significance.

Try to connect the reader with the scientific work by introducing a human element. You can even
weave a scientific story around someone else to add a personal touch.

Any complex subject can be clearly written with only a few technical words.

## Business Writing: Writing in Your Job

Whatever your job, be yourself when you write (maybe not Lawyers?)

Working at an institution, people write with clutter and long words to sound more important. For
example:

    "We have established a special phone communication system"
    vs
    "We setup an 800 number, please call 1-800-..."

Be short, warm, and personal. Be yourself.

## Humor

Humor is the secret weapon for nonfiction writers. Make people laugh about a serious matter to get
their attention. Many humorists have affected our society in serious ways: Jules Feiffer, Art
Buchwald, and Walt Kelly.

Most humor is based on fundamental truths - so readers can relate.

    "All humor must be about something - it must touch concretely on life."

Don't work too hard to get laughs. The best humor is built on surprise. Don't strive for humor and
hope to get some truths along the way. Don't strive for truth and hope to get some humor along the
way. Truth and humor should be intertwined.

# Attitudes

## The Sound of Your Voice

Don't alter your voice to fit the subject. Develop a single voice for your readers that's enjoyable
but avoids: breeziness, condescension, and cliches.

1. Breeziness: find the right balance of formality. You must still use good English, but don't sound
   too formal. Breezy writing is harder to read than proper English.
2. Condescension: write like you talk. Use words you'd normally use in speech, don't try to confuse
   your readers.
3. Cliches: are the enemy of good taste. They're overused to the point that it will annoy your
   readers. Good writers can't even avoid them on the first draft, but you can spot and remove them
   while rewriting.

## Enjoyment, Fear and Confidence

The reader must feel like the writer is having a good time, even if he or she isn't. If you find
funny material, mix it into your writing. Don't worry about pleasing all of your readers - most will
find it funny.

Fear of writing can freeze most writers in front of a blank screen or blank piece of paper. To get
confidence, Zinsser suggests that we right about subjects what interest us and what we care about.

To get interested about subjects, live an interesting life.

## The Tyranny of the Final Product

We worship the winning result. Gains made along the way are less glamarous: learning, wisdom,
growth, confidence, and dealing with failure.

Give yourself time to find the correct story to write about and from which angle to use. Zinsser
gave us a few examples of students from his class:

1. A student wanted to write about her old house. She was going to interview her siblings. Zinsser
   asked her if the story would be from her brother's or sister's point of view. She said it was
   from her own, so Zinsser told her to not waste time interviewing. Don't mix the point of views.
2. A student wanted to write about small cities disappearing from the US. She was going to write
   about it from a bird's eye viewpoint. Zinsser told her to pick one city and focus on it, then use
   that focus to inform the reader the problem at large.

To get a good final product, you'll have to go through many iterations. Take you time or you'll
never reach it. It all begins with your intentions. Figure out what you want to write, how you want
to write about it, and integrate humanity and integrity into the article.

## A Writer's Decision

There are hundreds of choices that go into writing an article. Zinsser shows us how he comes to many
small decisions over the course of writing one article.

A writer has to make his or her own luck. You have to "get on the plane". In this case, Zinsser
literally means get on a plane to visit different locations and get interesting stories.

## Write as Well as You Can

Always write as well as you can. Zinsser admired Joe DiMaggio, he always played the best game he
could. Someone asked him how he did it and Joe replied.

    "I always thought that there was at least one person in the stands who
     had never seen me play, and I didn't want to let him down."
