# Perfect English Grammar

Notes on Perfect English Grammar by Grant Barrett.

# General Principles

* consistency matters - choose and stick to a single tense, person, tone
* there isn't necessarily one answer for every language dilemma
* words can have more than one meaning/use
* English is sometimes illogical, don't fight it
* there are a lot of linguistic terms - it's more important to understand the concepts than know
  all the terms
* write for your audience instead of yourself, be appropriate for the situation
* write to be understood, don't let rules get in the way of good communication
* avoid doing things differently than everyone else
* simple does it, avoid tricks and being clever
* use a thesaurus only to remind yourself of words you already know, not to find new words - you're
  likely to misuse new words
* consult a dictionary or two
* use a style guide preferred by your organization/school/teacher/industry

# Composition

Think of words as bricks/boards, sentences as walls/windows, paragraphs as houses,
essays/stories/articles as neighborhoods. Your writing is a world for your readers, that you furnish
to delight them.

* writing is a learned process that doesn't come naturally to anyone
* writing has different rules than speaking
* writing is messy - it involves planning/revising/editing, nobody can do it perfectly in one try
* don't lose sight of your goal - to complete your writing project and delight your readers
* format at the end - bolding/italicizing/margins are distractions
* writing well isn't magic - you don't always need inspiration, sometimes you need to just do it

Write for the correct audience. There's a difference between writing formal university essays and
writing light/fun emails for clients. Recognize which tone is appropriate!

Break up your writer's block: build a structure first, just write anything, write a complete
plot summary first, tell someone else about your writing, start at the end and go backwards,
write the fun part first, write simply without worrying about the rules. Tell it like gossip.

Write below your level of learning. Write for a five-year old. Don't write the most educated first
line ever. Write to be understood. Write what helps you understand what your goals are: Who's your
audience? What do you want? What do they want? Who are the characters? What motivates them?

A paragraph is the foundation of writing structure. In formal writing, it has three parts: topic,
body, conclusion. It has two characteristics: it contains one main idea, it has multiple sentences.
Start a paragraph when introducing an essay or new idea, when concluding an essay or finishing an
idea, when an existing paragraph contains too many ideas, when trying to avoid a wall of text.

Paragraphs can be of any length but it's usually best to break down long paragraphs into several
shorter ones. The topic sentence is usually the first sentence, it's broad with just enough info
to introduce the ideas that will be explained in more detail later on. The body is where the
majority of the paragraph's work is done and explains more specifically what was hinted.

Good supporting sentences include: descriptions, data/statistics, quotes/paraphrases, examples,
definitions, contrasts/comparisons, a timeline or step-by-step report.

The concluding sentence summarizes what has been said. It's a natural final thought.

The five-paragraph essay is a classic structure taught in schools:

1. Paragraph 1: Introduction - provide a general opening statement. Sometimes
   provocative/controversial/surprising. Elaborate and provide background info. Give a specific
   statement of of purpose/topic, which can be your thesis or hypothesis.
2. Paragraph 2-3: Body Paragraphs - focus on a single most important argument/reason/fact. Use
   data/examples/anecdotes to reinforce your thesis.
3. Paragraph 5: Conclusion - rephrase your statement of purpose, emphasize why it's important,
   refer back to basic points of each paragraph, explain how the reader should feel, wrap it up
   with an assertive statement.

Develop a variety of transition techniques. Avoid simply jumping to the next topic. Inside of
sentences, use these words/phrases:

* although
* as a result
* at first
* eventually
* finally
* however
* next
* now
* then

Between sentences, use these words/phrases:

* A good example of that is
* As I wrote above
* Eventually
* Finally
* For instance
* Furthermore
* However
* In addition
* In conclusion
* In fact
* Indeed
* Just as with X, the facts show that Y is also
* More importantly
* On the other hand
* Overall
* Therefore
* This is also the opinion of Dr. Z, who believes
* To illustrate
* To put it briefly
* To summarize
* With this in mind

**Always lead with your best arguments, don't wait until the end.**

Always edit. We make a lot of mistakes as we write. To edit your own work: put writing aside and
come back to it later for a fresh perspective. If you don't have time, temporarily change the
typeface/font/margins for a fresh look. Don't be kind to your own writing.

# Parts of Speech Defined

* adjectives - modify/describe nouns
* adverbs - modify/describe adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs
* articles - determiners that introduce nouns (a, an, the, ...)
* conjunctions - connect clauses/sentences together
* determiners - words that control the meaning of a noun or noun phrase (the, this, that, my, few, ...)
* interjections - brief/abrupt insertions into speech, usually expressing emotion
* nouns - people, places, things
* prepositions - give context to nouns in relation to other nouns/pronouns (to, in, into, on, ...)
* pronouns - replace nouns or noun phrases (I, you, it, this, ...)
* verbs - show action or ongoing condition, are part of the predicate

# Spelling and Formatting

The best way to improve your spelling: read really interesting stuff just a little bit above your
skill level. If you like science, instead of reading about it in newspaper try reading "New Scientist"
magazine. When you look up words in a glossary/dictionary, keep them in a list to look up later.

Homophones are words that sound alike but are spelled differently. It's a common source of spelling
mistakes. Examples:

* accept vs except
* affect vs effect
* close vs clothes
* desert vs dessert
* discreet vs discrete
* ensure vs insure
* it's vs its
* lead vs led
* passed vs past
* principal vs principle
* than vs then
* their vs there vs they're
* to vs too vs two
* you're vs your

Common spelling rules:

* I before E except after C - there are too many exceptions to this rule: weird, their, height.
  An improved rule is "I before E except after C or when sounded as 'A' as in neighbor or weight".
* adding a suffix and dropping the E - change becomes changing, gauge becomes gauging, ice becomes
  icy, love becomes loving, rate becomes rating, ride becomes riding
* adding suffixes to words ending in Y - defy becomes defies, defied, defiance, defying

Affixes are semantic elements that can be added to a word to change its meaning. Prefixes go before,
suffixes go after, infixes go in the middle. Inflected endings are suffixes that modifies the tense
of a verb or the number.

Derivational suffixes (-able, -ant, -ly, -ness, -ology, -ure) change a word from one part of
speech to another.

Contractions are words made by combining other words and replacing some letters with an apostrophe.

Common possessive mistakes to avoid: an apostrophe never makes a word plural. Its vs it's (possessive
vs contraction of it is).

Dates should follow the format (in the US): July 30, 1970. Months, decades, and years can be
abbreviated in informal situations.

There are two types of numbers: cardinal and ordinal. Cardinal are the counting numbers. Ordinal
are used to show sequences. Examples: one vs first, two vs second, six vs sixth. The numbers
zero through nine should be written out as words. Numbers 10 and higher should be written out
as numerals. If you have a series of numbers, use the same style. It may be less distracting to
use general rather than specific numbers, eg "I scooted over a few inches" vs "I scooted over
four inches". Percentages are best written as numbers, except when they begin a sentence. Numbers
that start sentences should be written as words, unless it looks awkward.
