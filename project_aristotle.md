# Project Aristotle

Lessons learned from Google's research on what makes effective teams. The project is tribute to
Aristotle's quote:

> the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

Research results can be found on [rework](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/).

# What Makes A Team

**Work groups** have the least amount of interdependence. Based on organizational/managerial hierarchy,
they meet periodically to hear/share info.

**Teams** are highly interdependent. They plan work, solve problems, make decisions, review progress
for a specific project. Team members need each other to get work done.

Project Aristotle studied teams from 3 to 50 members, with a median of 9 members.

# What Is Effectiveness

Qualitative measurements were taken from 3x perspectives: executives, team leads, team members. They
rated teams, explained their ratings, and explained their different priorities.

Executives were concerned with results (sales numbers or product launches). Team members were
concerned with team culture. Team leads had a mix of concerns that included: ownership, vision, and
goals.

The researches decided to focus on:

1. executive evaluation of team
2. team leader evaluation of team
3. team member evaluation of team
4. sales performance against quarterly quota

# Data And Measurements

Researches studied 180 teams, 115 in engineering and 65 in sales. They tested team composition
(personality traits, skills, demographics) and dynamics. Participants were asked to agree/disagree:

* group dynamics: I feel safe expressing divergent opinions to the team
* skill sets: I am good at navigating roadblocks and barriers
* personality traits: I see myself as someone who is a reliable worker
* emotional intelligence: I am not interested in other people's problems (empathy)

Tenure, level, and location were also collected.

# Dynamics Of Effective Teams

**What really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.**

In order of importance:

1. **psychological safety** - belief that a team is safe for risk taking in the face of being seen
   as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive. With high psychological safety, teammates
   feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel like no other team member will
   embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering an idea.
2. **dependability** - members reliably complete quality work on time and do not shirk responsibilities.
3. **structure and clarity** - members understand job expectations, how to fulfill expectations,
   and consequences of one's performance for team effectiveness. Google uses OKRs for goal setting.
4. **meaning** - find a sense of purpose in the work or its output. This is personal and can vary
   between team members: financial security, supporting family, helping team, self-expression, etc...
5. **impact** - subjective judgement that your work is making a difference. Seeing how your individual
   work is contributing to the organization's goals.

Summary: team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other. They get
things done on time with a high bar for excellence. They have clear roles/plans/goals. Work is
personally important to members. Members think their work matters and creates change.

It seems like meaning is what a member derives from their work/organization. Whereas impact is what
their work/organization derives from the member.

These variables were not significantly connected with team effectiveness: co-location of teammates,
consensus-driven decision making, extroversion of members, individual performance of members,
workload size, seniority, team size, or tenure. While not important for team effectiveness, they can
still be important elsewhere.

# Help Teams Determine Their Own Needs

Suggested action item: make a survey and ask your team how they feel about the five pillars. Do
they strongly agree/disagree with:

* if I make a mistake on our team, it is not held against me
* when my teammates say they'll do something, they follow through with it
* our team has an effective decision-making process
* the work I do for our team is meaningful to me
* I understand how our team's work contributes to the organization's goals

# Foster Psychological Safety

Of the five key dynamics, psychological safety was by far the most important. It makes employees
less likely to leave and more likely to harness power of diverse ideas.

Asking a basic question like "what's the goal of this project?" or "what's the definition of done"
may make you sound like you're out of the loop. It might feel easier to continue without getting
clarification to avoid being perceived as ignorant.

Measure a team's level of psychological safety by surveying:

1. if you make a mistake on this team, if is often held against you
2. members can bring up problems and tough issues
3. members reject others for being different
4. it's safe to take a risk on this team
5. it's difficult to ask members for help
6. no one on this team would deliberately act in a way to undermine my efforts
7. my unique skills/talents are valued/utilized

Three ways to foster psychological safety:

1. frame work as a learning problem instead of execution problem
2. acknowledge your own fallibility
3. model curiosity and ask lots of questions

# Help Teams Take Action

Three steps to help take action:

1. establish a common vocabulary
2. create a forum to discuss team dynamics
3. commit leaders to reinforcing and improving
