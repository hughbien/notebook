# Rise

Notes for Rise by Patty Azzarello.

# Introduction: Working vs Succeeding

**Nobody but you has motivation to make you less busy.** If you're too busy with your current role,
you're not ready for the next role. You're expected to deal with an overwhelming workload by:

* creating systems and processes to get things done with less effort
* think strategically to prioritize and focus
* eliminate the non-essential
* deliver higher-value outcomes (as opposed to doing busy work)

**Ruthlessly prioritize by overachieving where it counts.** Don't do everything. Ruthlessly focus
on where you can make the best impact. Communicate those ruthless priorities over and over again.

**The world won't come to an end if you take time.** Claim time for yourself to think about the
bigger picture. Decide how much time should be reserved for each area of work, stick to that.
Prioritize: things you'll get done, things you don't think you will, things you can't get to at all.

# Do Better: Have More Impact

**Do the things you're naturally good at, most of the time.** Take time to understand what your
strengths are. Then tune your job to fit your strengths via negotiation.

**People value you for your output delivered.** They don't care how hard you worked, how much time
you spent at work, or what it cost you. Show that you can get work done while freeing yourself
from being overwhelmed by work.

**Every time you're promoted to a new level, how you're evaluated changes.** A manager's value
becomes developing strategy and teams instead of individual contribution. Spend more time thinking
and less time doing. Earn your team's respect with leadership instead of individual work. Lift
everyone on your team up.

**Invest in delegation, teaching, and defining clear goals.** Don't take the short/easy path. You're
working in a team. Trust them and encourage them. Lift everyone on your team up!

# Look Better: Be Visible, But Not Annoying

**Your career will stall if you don't build your credibility.** Make sure your work is recognized.
Demonstrate why your hard work matters to the company. The more credibility you build now, the less
time you'll have to spend defending your decisions later on.

**Define and develop a personal brand.** It will help you move faster, be more decisive, and be
more effective.

**Develop a habit of: selling, performing, and motivating.** It takes planning and you'll need to
put yourself out there. It takes practice. You'll get better over time. You need to actively sell
your ideas, constantly.

# Connect Better: Get Support

**Ask for help.** Don't try to do everything yourself.

**Networking has two parts: keeping in touch with people you already know and meeting new people.**
Networking is about giving, not taking. Think about how you can help people in your network. Give
when you don't need anything. Take less than you give.

**Take time to step away from work, schedule time to stay connected.** It gets easier as you go and
it's important for your career.

# Go!: Make Your Work and Your Life Work

**It's okay to be terrified. All executives feel at certain points like they're in over their heads,
don't know what to do, aren't doing a good enough job, or are going to be "found out".** Take leaps
and throw yourself in situations where you don't know much, where you'll be challenged. Trust
yourself.

**Take responsibility to make times to do things exceed expectations, but also claim time for home.**
You'll make more impact at work if you're happy outside of work too.
