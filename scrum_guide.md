# Scrum Guide

Notes for <https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html>.

# Definition

Lightweight framework that helps teams generate value through adaptive solutions. TLDR:

1. Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog
2. Scrum Team turns selection of work into an Increment of value during a Sprint
3. Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect results and adjust for next Sprint
4. Repeat

# Theory

It's founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Knowledge comes from experience and making decisions
based on what's observed. Employ an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and
to control risk. Engage groups of people collectively. Use their skills and expertise.

The Scrum pillars are transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

Transparency - process and work must be visible to those performing and receiving work. Decisions
are based on perceived state of formal artifacts.

Inspection - artifacts and progress towards agreed goals must be inspected frequently and
diligently to detect potentially undesired variances/problems.

Adaptation - if aspects of process deviate outside acceptable limits, or results are unacceptable,
process must be adjusted. Make the adjustment as soon as possible.

# Values

Five values of Scrum are: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage

Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

# Team

The team consists of: one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. No sub-teams or
hierarchies. Focused on one objective at a time, Product Goal.

Scrum Teams are cross-functional, members have all the skills necessary to create value. They are
also self-managing.

Team is small enough to remain nimble but large enough to complete significant work. Typically 10
or fewer. They're responsible for all product related activities: stakeholder collaboration,
verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development.

Developers - create any aspect of usable Increment each Sprint. Accountable for creating a plan
for the sprint (Sprint Backlog), instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done, adapting
their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal, holding each other accountable.

Product Owner - accountable for maximizing value of product resulting from work of the Scrum Team.
Handles Product Backlog management. Develops and explicitly communicates Product Goal, creating
Backlog Items, ordering Backlog Items, ensuring Backlog is transparent/visible/understood.

Scrum Master - accountable for establishing Scrum. They help everyone understand Scrum theory and
practice. They coach the team in self-management and cross-functionality, focus on creating
high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done, remove impediments, ensure Scrum events
are positive/productive. They also help the Product Owner by finding techniques for effective
Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management.

# Events

Sprint - all the necessary work to achieve Product Goal (including planning/scrums/reviews/retros)
happen within the Sprint. During a Sprint: no changes are made that would endanger the goal,
quality does not decrease, Product Backlog is refined as needed, scope may be clarified/renegotiated
with the Product Owner.

Sprint Planning - initiate the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed. Product Owner ensures
attendees are prepared to discuss most important backlog items and how they map to the goal. Sprint
Planning addresses the topics:

1. Why is this Sprint valuable? Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.
2. What can be Done this Sprint? Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the
   current Sprint. Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, to increase confidence.
3. How will the chosen work get done? Developers can decompose Product Backlog items into smaller
   work items of one day or less.

Daily Scrum - the purpose is to inspect progress toward Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog
as necessary. It's a 15-minute event for Developers. It's held same time and place every working
day of the Sprint. If Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items, they will
participate as Developers. Daily Scrums help: improve communications, identify impediments, promote
quick decision-making, eliminate need for other meetings.

Sprint Review - inspect outcome of Sprint and determine future adaptations. Scrum Team presents
results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed. Scrum
Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished and what has changed. Attendees collaborate on
what to do next.

Sprint Retrospective - plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. Scrum Team inspects how
the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and Definition of
Done. Scrum Team discusses what went well, what problems were encountered, and how these problems were
or were not solved. The team identifies most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness.

# Artifacts

Product Backlog - backlog for the Product Goal. Ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.
Refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining items into smaller more precise items.
There is an ongoing activity to add details like description, order, and size.

Sprint Backlog - backlog for the Sprint Goal. Composed of the Sprint Goal (why), set of items
selected for the Sprint (what), and an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how). It's
highly visible, real-time picture of work that Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint.

Increment - progress towards Definition of Done. It's a concrete stepping stone toward the Product
Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified. Multiple
Increments may be created within a Sprint. Sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review.
They may be delivered to stakeholders prior to end of the Sprint.

Definition of Done - formal description of state of Increment when it meets the quality measures
required for the product. Acceptance criteria.
