# Sense of Style

Notes on Sense of Style by Steven Pinker. It's a style manual for writing.

Style adds beauty to the world. A crisp sentence, arresting metaphor, witty aside, elegant turn
of phrase are among life's greatest pleasures.

A quick overview:

* the goal of clear writing is to ensure the reader doesn't stumble through prose.
* words and grammar evolve over time, refer to latest edition of any guide but be doubtful
* eliminate cliche from writing
* eliminate jargon and minimize modifiers: adjectives, adverbs, etc... (use more verbs!)
* write like how you speak
* English syntax is usually: subject, verb, object - in that order.

# Good Writing

A good writer deliberately uses surprising transitions: colons, dashes, block quotations - these are
all hallmarks of lively prose.

A writer controls the reader's perspective on an ongoing story; much like how a cinematographer
uses camera angles and quick cuts for a film.

* use fresh wording instead of familiar verbiage
* use concrete images over abstract ones
* once in a while, use an uncommon word or idiom. But keep most prose simple.

# A Window Onto The World

The purpose of writing is presentation. The writer orients the reader's gaze to see into a window
of his world.

You don't need to argue for the truth; you just need to present it.

You can show the reader something in the world or engage the reader in conversation. Showing means
pointing the reader to something concrete - for example, people interacting with objects.
Conversation means the reader is cooperative. The reader can read between the lines and connect
the dots without having everything spelled out.

A technique to introduce a topic for conversation is to ask a question.

Minimize abstractions. Don't write about what cannot be seen with the eye unless you have to.

Use classic style. As the writer, you know something about the world. The reader is your equal, but
does not notice what you notice yet. Point it out to them.

# The Curse Of Knowledge

As a writer, you're writing for someone else who does not know something that you know.

This curse is why bad writing occurs. It's why readers don't understand your writing, because the
reader can't visualize your writing with their missing knowledge. It's your job to educate.

Remove abstraction. Most of our brains is dedicated to vision.

It's best to re-read your material after enough time has passed that the text is no longer familiar.
Make edits from here.

# The Web, The Tree, And The String

Understanding syntax helps a writer avoid bad grammar, convolution, and misleading prose.

Syntax is made up of a tree of phrases to translate a web of thoughts into a string of words.

Parts of speech:

* nouns (including pronouns) - man, play, Sophocles, she, my
* verbs - marry, write, think, see, imply
* prepositions - in, around, underneath, before, until
* adjectives - big, red, wonderful, interesting, demented
* adverbs - merrily, frankly, impressively, very, almost
* articles and other determinatives - the, a, some, this, that, many, one, two, three
* coordinators - and, or, nor, but, yet, so
* subordinators - that, whether, if, to

Replace obese phrases with learner alternatives:

* "make an appearance with" vs "appear with"
* "is capable of being" vs "can be"
* "is dedicated to providing" vs "provides"
* "in the event that" vs "if"
* "it is imperative that we" vs "we must"
* "brought about the organization of" vs "organized"
* "significantly expedite the process of" vs "speed up"
* "only a daily basis" vs "daily"
* "for the purpose of" vs "to"
* "in the matter of" vs "about"
* "in view of the fact that" vs "since"
* "it is widely observed that ..." vs "..."

Employ some elements of poetry. Establish rhythm in your prose. Consider using parallel structure -
two almost identical sentence except one key difference, which highlights the difference even more so.

# Arcs Of Coherence

Ensure that the reader will grasp the topic, get the point, keep track of the players, and see
how one idea follows from another.

Structure sections as an "issue" or topic. Follow it up with a "discussion" or comments. State the
point at the end of the issue.

Coherence beings with the writer and reader being clear about the topic. Let the reader know what
the topic is as early as possible.

Similar to topics and comments, always write given knowledge before introducing new knowledge.

Start strong. "We're going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones." is a terrific leading
sentence. It's an unpleasant fact followed by paradox.

Always write light before heavy. If you have a complicated phrase, move it to the end of a paragraph.
