# The Side Hustle

Notes on [The Side Hustle](https://www.sidehustlenation.com) by Nick Loper.

# The "Big 3" Business Models

Businesses fall into one of three categories:

1. Selling as a Service - quick to start with low costs, but trading time for money
2. Selling a Product - time leveraged and easier to scale, but intensive upfront costs
3. Selling an Audience - time leveraged and flexible, but slower path to making money

# 7 Proven Frameworks for Generating Business Ideas

1. Rip, Pivot, Jam - copy a successful business model, apply it to a new industry/vertical,
   then hustle to get customers.
2. Sniper - focus on a specific audience to deliver a better product and have better marketing
3. Shovels in a Gold Rush - sell tools to an existing audience that needs it for their own business
4. Intersection - find potential service business ideas at the intersection of your
   skills/interests/network
5. Scratch-Your-Own-Itch - solve your own problem
6. Expert Enough - what do your friends/family/peers ask for help with?
7. Probing for Pain - call a business owner and ask them for their biggest challenges

# Starting a Service Business

What service could you sell? Start with your own resume and work history. List out the potential
skills you could freelance. Check freelance marketplaces to find other ideas.

How will you find clients? Use your existing network or consider using other people's audiences.
For example, approach companies your potential customers are already doing business with. Can you
co-host a workshop? Also consider Facebook Groups and marketplaces.

How to scale a service business? Raise your rates. Consider transitioning to servicing groups
instead of one single client. Build a team or agency. Or create "productized" packages.

# Starting a Product Business

Physical Products - first determine what to sell, then how you'll source your inventory. You'll
also have to store your inventory and determine where to sell your product. You'll need a system
to collect payments and handle shipping/logistics/returns. Amazon Arbitrage is a popular side hustle,
look into Amazon's FBA program. Private Labeling is another popular physical product business.

Hybrid Products - where you sell a physical product but you never actually touch the end product.
This can be done via drop shipping, print-on-demand products, and product licensing. In drop shipping,
the supplier sends the product directly to the end customer. Print-on-demand eliminates inventory
risk. When coming up with ideas, think of seasonal/evergreen/trending items. Lastly, product
licensing involves selling the idea to someone else to execute.

Digital Products - where you sell e-books, online courses, and software. As a bonus of selling
books/courses, you become a expert on the subject and can use it as your business card. Consider
using a tiered pricing system.

# Starting an Audience Business

An audience business is most flexible and time-leveraged, but can be difficult to make money from.
Building an audience usually takes a long time, but the payoff can be worth it.

Creating Content - you'll need to create a resource that's worth paying attention to. People are
only online to be entertained or to solve a problem. Also consider what type of content to generate:
articles, podcasts, or videos. Try to target a niche and make sure to evaluate the competitive
landscape.

Building an Audience - be so good they can't ignore you. The best marketing is word of mouth given
for amazing resources. Go where your target customers already are to market. Consider using SEO,
social media, guest posting/podcasting, and paid advertising.

Monetizing an Audience - you can use affiliate links, sell your own products/services, use
advertising/sponsors, or start a membership club.
