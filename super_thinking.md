# Super Thinking

Notes on Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann.

Mental models are concepts or frameworks we can use to make decisions or problem solve. This book
is a huge list of mental models and how to use them.

# Being Wrong Less

Inverse Thinking - it might be easier to focus on being less wrong (rather than focus on being
more right). Consider the inverse. In sports, focus on not losing a point instead of gaining a point.
Focus on making fewer mistakes.

First Principles - identify your assumptions, break down the problem into its fundamental principles,
create new solutions from scratch. Use this to better understand your problem and solutions.

Root Causes - get down to the real reason why something happened. Keep asking "why" until you get
to the root cause.

Seeking Out Third Story - find the story that an impartial observer would recount. There's a gap between
what you know and what someone else knows. To close the gap, explain things from the third-person's
point of view.

Availability Bias - when information is made available, you'll distort your objective view of reality.

Fundamental Attribution Error - when you think someone is mean, rather than thinking they were just
having a bad day.

Optimistic Probability Bias - being too optimistic about the probability of success.

Ockham's Razor - the simplest explanation is the most likely to be true.

Hanlon's Razor - never attribute to malice things that are adequately explained by carelessness.

Most Respectful Interpretation - don't immediately assume people are disrespecting you, they're
probably just busy or having a bad day. Build trust with people long term.

Learned Helplessness - if someone experiences difficulties/hardships over long period of time, they
will see their actions as futile. This is not the case. Your actions will help yourself.

Semmelweis Reflex - even with new evidence, people hold tight onto their pre-existing beliefs.

De-risking - test your assumptions in the real world first, before risking more.

Antifragile - some things are fragile, they break under hardship. Some things are robust, they're
strong and survive under stress. Antifragile things benefit when exposed to volatility/disorder and
love adventure/risk/uncertainty. It's beyond resilience and robustness. Antifragile things get
better, because they adapt from difficult situations.

Premature Optimization - perfecting something too early, pouring effort into something that will be
wasted.

Thinking Gray - the truth is not black or white, it's usually a shade of gray.

Confirmation Bias - interpreting information in a biased way to confirm your pre-existing beliefs.

Devil's Advocate - take up an opposing side of an argument, even if you don't agree with it, to poke
holes in your belief.

Frame of Reference - you only see life from your own perspective. Consider it from other people's
perspectives. There's a difference.

# Anything That Can Go Wrong, Will

Spillover Effects - activities will have effects that spill over from outside its core.

Externality - cost incurred or benefit received by a third party who has no control over factors
that created the cost/benefit.

Public Goods - benefits that are non excludable, so everyone has access to it even without paying
for it.

Tragedy of the Commons - individuals in a shared resource system act independently, in self-interest,
contrary to the common good and end up spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.
For example: farmers take their cows to a shared pasture of grass. Individually, farmers want as many
cows on the pasture to feed as possible. But by collectively doing so, the grass won't regrow in time
and will be completely depleted. Everybody has an interest in preserving a resource, but no one has
an interest in preserving it.

Free Rider Problem - burden of shared resource when it's overused by people who aren't paying their
fair share for it (or anything at all). For example: refusing vaccination because you don't get
sick, this reduces herd immunity.

Asymmetric Information - one side of transaction has different information than the other side.

Principal Agent Problems - self interest of agent leads to suboptimal results for the principal. For
example, a real estate agent may sell a house for cheaper because his fee is a small percentage of
the overall sale, which isn't worth the extra week of effort.

Goodhart's Law - basing rewards on a metric may cause unintended/undesirable outcomes. For example,
Vietnam had a rat problem and rewarded people for rats killed with proof being a rat tail. Rat catchers
only cut the tail off and let rats free, so they could reproduce and create more rats. Or in India
where people actively breed poisonous snakes to increase their bounty profits.

Short-termism - focusing on short-term results over long-term results.

Path Dependence - your available set of decisions is a result of your past decisions. For example,
the QWERTY layout of the keyboard is due to the designers trying to slow down typists so their
typewriters wouldn't be over-heated. Even if it's ineffective and illogical, changing it would cost
too much.

Preserve Optionality - make choices that preserves your future options.

Precautionary Principle - an action can create harm, proceed with caution.

Irreversible vs Reversible Decisions - it's usually better to choose the option that is easier to
reverse.

Analysis Paralysis - over analyzing large amounts of information upfront (or spending too much time
planning) rather than taking action to get closer to your goals.

Murphy's Law - anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

# Spend Your Time Wisely

North Star - have a guiding vision and choose activities based on that.

Most Important Tasks - pick your most important activities and single-task on that. Or work on what's
on the top of your mind. Don't multi-task.

Eisenhower Decision Matrix - 2x2 grid to prioritize tasks. One axis is urgent/not urgent. Other axis
is important/not important. Do the urgent + important tasks. Schedule the not urgent + important tasks.
Delegate the urgent + not important tasks. Eliminate the not urgent + not important tasks.

Parkinson's Law - work expands to fill the time allotted. If you have a lot of free time assigned
to a project, you'll fill it up with unimportant work.

Bikeshedding - investment of time/energy into unimportant but easy discussions. When planning a nuclear
power plant, most members of the groups will spend more time discussing the color of the bikeshed --
because it's easy -- even though it's unimportant. In a meeting, set a clear agenda.

Opportunity Cost - every choice has a hidden cost, the value of the best alternative opportunity you
didn't choose. For example, going to college has the opportunity cost of the amount of money
you could have earned while studying. But not going to college also has an opportunity cost, you won't
earn the additional salary that a degree might earn.

Pareto Principle (80/20) - find the ~20% of effort you can put in to get ~80% of the result.

Diminishing Returns - spending time/resources on something will get you good results. But as you
spend more time/resources, the efficiency of the good results will decrease. For example, one
chocolate bar makes you happy. A 3rd chocolate bar in the same day, you'll probably still be happy
but less so. Your 100th chocolate bar? Probably won't be happy anymore.

Default Setting - schedule default commitments for your long-term goals.

Present Bias - overvaluing near-term rewards over incremental progress on long-term goals. We
procrastinate making lists instead of taking action, because lists are easy and give us near-term
rewards.

Loss Aversion - getting more displeasure from losing than pleasure from gaining. Loss aversion
prevents us from taking reasonable risk.

Sunk-Cost Fallacy - stubbornly adhering to a situation because you've already experienced loss from
it, even though by doing so you're losing more. For example, staying in a job you hate because you've
already dedicated 1-2 years of your life to it.

Design Patterns - reusable solutions to common problems.

# Becoming One With Nature

Experimental Mindset - look for opportunities to run experiments and apply the scientific method.

Flywheels - look for opportunities to create/join a good flywheel, a system that may take upfront
effort but once started will take very little effort to keep spinning.

Strategy Tax - long-term commitment with inertia to a strategy, that leads to suboptimal decisions.
Committing to certain goals will sometimes come with a bad tax. Want to be a wealthy drug dealer?
You've committed to risking a lifetime jail sentence.

Lindy Effect - if a product has lasted 20 years on the market, it will probably last the next 20.

Technology Adoption Lifecycle - innovators, early adopters, majority, laggards.

Forcing Function - any task, activity, or event that forces you to take action and produce a result.
For example, a scheduled recurring appointment with a trainer/coach. Or a standard standup meeting.

Luck Surface Area - find ways to increase your luck, such as meeting more people or launching more
side projects.

Zero-sum - situations where the total rewards must be split between all participants, eg for two
people that might mean one winner and one loser. Instead, look for win-win scenarios, where all
parties involved end up better.

Entropy - everything tends towards disorder and chaos. You use energy to keep it organized.

# Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics

Monte Carlo/Gambler's Fallacy - the underlying probability may not change, there's no such thing as
a lucky or unlucky streak.

Maslow's Hammer - if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Anecdotal Evidence - informal evidence from personal stories.

Correlation Does Not Imply Causation - the data doesn't necessarily explain the reason.

Nocebo Effect - Opposite of placebo. If something bad happens, we convince ourselves that negative
events will soon take place.

Experiment - look for controlled experiments and A/B testing.

False Negative/Positive - be aware that false negatives/positives will exist in the data.

Selection Bias - you pay more attention to things that confirm what you already believe. You select
data in your results that confirm your hypothesis, instead of looking at the overall data.

Response Bias - conditions that lead to biases in survey responses. For example, there's a social
desirability bias if you ask someone "is it ok to drink alcohol frequently?" they'll mostly respond
"No" to adhere to societal expectations, instead of answering truthfully.

Survivorship Bias - you pay more attention to your surviving data points than looking at the data
overall. For example, WWII bombers came back with bullet holes in body and tail. They put armor on
those parts of the plane, but this did not increase number of planes returning because the planes
that didn't survive were being hit at the spots not having bullet holes.

Replication and Systematic Review - replication aims to repeat a research study to determine if
basic findings can be applied to other situations. A systematic review is a qualitative review and
summary of other research. 

Error Bars - representations of variability in data to indicate the error/uncertainty in measurement.

# Decisions, Decisions

Pro-Con List - when trying to make a decision, the go-to framework for people is to make a pro-con
list to help them decide what's best, weighing the positives against the negatives.

Cost Benefit Analysis - process used to measure the benefits of a decision versus the costs associated
with taking the action.

Decision Tree - graphical representation of every potential outcome of making different decisions.
Can be weighted with probabilities. Useful tool for making decisions.

Sensitivity Analysis - financial model that determines how target variables changed based on how
input variables change.

Black Swan - a low probability, high impact event that was almost entirely unexpected. Black Swan
theory suggests we embrace the uncertainty instead of planning for it (since it's impossible to
predict). We should reduce dependence on single points of failure and work on our adaptability.

Systems Thinking - consider the entire system as a whole, including how all of its parts work
together, so that making a decision won't have unintended/negative effects.

Scenario Analysis - a process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative
possible outcomes, or alternative worlds.

Simulations - imitate real world processes/systems over time.

Group Think - psychological phenomenon that occurs when a group of people, each with desire for
harmony/conformity, come up with a decision that is irrational or unconstructive.

Divergent and Lateral Thinking - divergent thinking is the process of generating as many creative
ideas as possible. It's free flowing, brainstorming, and non-linear. Lateral thinking follows a
process that leads to one solution, using a series of logical steps.

Global Optimum - a local optimum is the best solution within a neighboring set of solutions, whereas
a global optimum is the best out of all possible solutions.

# Dealing with Conflict

Prisoner's Dilemma - a group of people may not cooperate, even if it's in their best interest to.
For example, two prisoners can rat each other out or stay quiet. If they stay quiet, they both go
free. If either talks, the one talking gets a reduced sentence of 2 years while the other gets 10
years. In this situation, they both talk and get 10 years -- instead of staying quiet.

Ultimatum Game - two parties interact, first player proposes how to divide a sum of money with the
second player. Second player can accept or reject. If second player rejects, both players get
nothing.

War of Attrition - a prolonged war where each side seeks to gradually wear out the other via a series
of small scale attacks. The war is usually won by whichever side has greater resources.

Ciadini's Six Principles of Influence - Persuasiveness via reciprocity (people tend to return a favor),
commitment (people tend to honor their commitments), social proof (people do things they see other
people are doing), authority (people tend to obey authority figures), liking (people are persuaded
by other people they like), scarcity (perceived scarcity will generate demand).

Dark Patterns - user interfaces designed to trick people.

Social Norms - collective representations of acceptable group conduct. They usually give a sense of
community, involve friends/family, and can be fuzzy.

Market Norms - acceptable behaviors for business exchanges. They usually have clear objectives,
transactional, and based on business.

Distributive Justice - addresses how society should distribute its resources fairly. Determines
who gets what.

Procedural Justice - addresses how fairly people are treated and how disputes are resolved.

Retributive Justice - how should people be punished for their wrong-doing.

Restorative Justice - how to repair the harm that an offender has done to the victim(s).

Appeal to Emotion - manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid argument.

Mutually Assured Destruction - threat of deterrence, the threat of strong weapons between enemies
prevents both enemies from attacking. For example, full scale nuclear attacks from enemies prevent
any enemy from using their weapon.

Containment - strategy to stop the expansion of the enemy.

Guerrilla Warfare - irregular warfare where small groups such as paramilitary, armed civilians, or
irregulars use tactics like ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit and run, and mobility to
fight larger and less mobile armies.

Exit Strategy - a strategy to leave one's current situation, either successfully or to mitigate failure.

# Unlocking People's Potential

Peter Principle - "managers rise to the level of their incompetence". People are promoted based on
their performance in their current job, not how they will perform in their new role. So employees will
stop being promoted once they hit a role they can't perform well.

Directly Responsible Individual - good things come when someone is explicitly responsible for it.
Related to bystander effect, where people don't offer help to victim if there are other people present.

Deliberate Practice - to become an expert in a skill, you can't just perform endless hours of naive
practice. You need to have purposeful practice: breaking down the skill into specific chunks,
fixing your weakness by practicing specifically, developing an immediate feedback system, focusing
intensely, pushing yourself to more challenging levels, and having a coach mentor you. 

Consequence-Conviction Matrix - if you have low consequence and low confidence in your own ability,
you should delegate. Delegate completely (let people make their own mistakes to learn from it). If
confidence in yourself is high and consequence is high, you should do it yourself.

Radical Candor - framework for giving feedback. You want to care personally and challenge directly.
Show that you give a damn about the person. But also be willing to criticize and say the difficult
things.

Imposter Syndrome - persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud, even if you're not. Individuals 
doubt their own skills and talents.

Dunning-Kruger Effect - unskilled individuals mistakenly assess their abilities to be much higher
than it actually is. People wrongly over-estimate their knowledge in a specific area because of a
lack of self awareness. As their knowledge grows in a subject, at the beginning, a person will be
extremely confident. But after a peak of confidence, it will drop immediately, because they'll learn
that they didn't know much to begin with. You don't know what you don't know.

Winning Hearts and Minds - in which one side seeks to prevail not by the use of superior force, but
by making emotional or intellectual appeals to sway supporters of the other side.

# Flex Your Market Power

Product/Market Fit - the degree to which a product satisfies market demand. It means being in a good
market, with a product that can satisfy that market.

Pivot - structured course correction designed to test a new hypothesis of a product or strategy.

Moat - something defensible that you've built for your business, an unfair advantage. This could be
strategic partnerships, brand, infrastructure, etc...

Crossing the Chasm - there is a chasm between early adopters and early majority. There are techniques
you can use to cross this chasm: choose a target market, positioning your product, building a
market strategy, choosing the best distribution channel or pricing.
