# Thinking in Systems

Notes from Thinking in Systems by Donella H. Meadows.

**Everything is a system -- a set of connected elements with a shared goal.**

Our bodies, communities, world are all functional systems. They're working either for or against you.
If you want to improve your life, you'll need to dive deeper and think at a systemic level to improve
inefficiencies.

There are three parts to a system: elements, connections of elements, the shared goal/purpose.

**Feedback loops provides sustainability for systems.**

The shared goal of a system may not be explicitly stated. You'll have to figure it out through
observation and experimentation.

Observe a system's behavior (stock and flow). The stock are the elements that you can track, for
example money in the economy. Flow is the change of stock over time, for example how much money
you save or spend.

Feedback lets you measure a system's behavior to determine if it's meeting its desired goal. It can
be balancing or reinforcing. Balancing means getting a system's stock to a desired level, eg you
want an exact amount of money in your account. Reinforcing means drives a system in a direction
faster. For example, savings and compound interest will exponentially increase your wealth.

**Systems are good if: they're resilient, self-organized, and hierarchical**

A resilient system can adapt to changing conditions. It's anti-fragile.

A self-organized system will use feedback to learn and adapt on its own, to build its own set of
rules.

A hierarchical system reduces complexity by delegating responsibilities to different parts of the
systems. This is similar to programming, where we want each part of a system to have a single
responsibility.

**A system's rules can be adjusted to improve efficiency and effectiveness.**

System buffers, or bottlenecks, can be increased to increase the system's output.

System designs can be optimized -- not just for efficiency but also to make it more resilient,
self organized, or less complex.

System delays can be shortened -- so that changes to a system will immediately impact it. This
speeds up the feedback loop and introduces leverage.

**Everything is a system -- define systems and mental models to better understand and optimize your world.**

Be careful of unforeseen consequences. Increasing an input to a system will not linearly increase
the output. Observe systems, measure them, make changes, and repeat.
