User mapping is a technique to tell user stories via words/pictures, with the goal of building a
consensus or shared understanding between team members. The goal isn't to build a roadmap. It's to
arrive at a common understanding.

Mapping consists of:

* building user personas
* identifying activities
* writing out tasks/stories for each activity using formulas like "As a..., I want to..., so that..."

# The Big Picture

The goal of user stories is to build shared understanding or consensus among teammates and
stakeholders. This happens when every person understands what the other person is imagining and
why. Documents don't have the whole picture. Requirements cannot make good stories. Tell stories
through collaboration with words/pictures. Stories are discussions about solving problems for
organizations/customers/users that lead to agreement about what to build.

Stories get their name from how they're used, not what is written. Story maps break down big
stories. Talk and document, write cards as you think out loud to tell stories. Reorganize cards
together to communicate. Map stories to help find holes. Focus on breadth before diving into the
depth.

# Plan to Build Less

Mapping builds shared understanding in groups. It can be used to visualize dependencies across
multiple teams. Instead of scope creep, you'll get understanding growth.

Focus on outcomes, what users need to do and see when the system comes out. Plan out releases to
get those outcomes. Focus on specific target outcomes.

Prioritization model:

* differentiator - killer feature that differentiates from competitors
* spoiler - feature that moves in on someone else's differentiator
* cost reducer - reduces organization costs
* table stakes - feature necessary to compete in marketplace

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the smallest product release that successfully achieves its
desired outcomes. The Minimum Viable Solution is the smallest solution release. The MVP should
prove or disprove your assumptions.

# Plan to Learn Faster

Validate your hypothesis/problem actually exists. Sketch/prototype to envision your solution. Test
with users to learn whether your solution is valuable/usable. Treat every release as an experiment
and be mindful of what you want to learn. The goal is to learn if we are building the right thing.

# Plan to Finish On Time

Map only what's necessary to support the conversation. Best estimates will come from developers who
really understand the foundation. Use iterative thinking to evaluate/make changes. Use incremental
thinking to add things.

# You Already Know How

Six Steps to Story Mapping:

1. frame the problem - who's the user and why do we need to build this
2. map the big picture - focus on breadth instead of depth
3. explore - go deep and talk about different user personas, how else they might do things, determine
   what can go wrong
4. release strategy - focus on goals for business and people you're serving
5. learning strategy - use the map to discuss bigger risks, slice it into MVP experiments
6. development strategy - build things early to help learn and spot technical issues

# The Real Story About Stories

Best solutions come from collaboration between people with problems and the people who can solve
them. Have a conversation to arrive at the best solution and shared understanding. Good
conversations have lots of words and pictures.

# Telling Better Stories

Use a story template to start with. Here's a checklist of subjects to tackle:

* talk about the "who"
* talk about the "what"
* talk about the "why"
* what's going on outside the software?
* what can go wrong
* what are some questions/assumptions
* what are alternative solutions?
* how can we solve this problem?
* how long will it take?

# It Is Not All On The Card

What's on the card:

* short title
* description
* story number
* estimate, size or budget
* value
* metrics
* dependencies
* status
* dates

Use tools to post pictures, videos, and text. Use tools to sequence, analyze, and track progress.

# The Card Is Just The Beginning

After implementation, inspect the results of your work: user experience quality, functional quality,
code quality. Use stories to drive the making of anything, software or not.

# Bake Stories Like A Cake

Is the story too expensive? What are alternative solutions that will still solve the user's problem.

Is the story too big? Break it into smaller parts that will let you evaluate progress sooner.

Deliver a half baked cake, not a half baked cake.

# Rock Breaking

From the user's perspective, a story should fulfill a need. From the developer's perspective, it's
a unit of work that takes less than a few days to build/test. From a business perspective, it helps
achieve a business outcome.

Conversations are best to break down big stories. Use it to agree that a problem is worth solving,
go forward -- or to trash it.

Epics are large stories that we need to break down.

Use discovery to examine: who the customers/users are, how their needs are met today without your
solution, how the world would change for them with your solution, how your solution should look
and behave, how long your solution might take to build.

Reflect on product quality and processes. Learn by testing meaningful chunks. Use metrics and
conversations with users.

# Rock Breakers

Product managers are responsible for determining that a product is: valuable, usable, feasible.

A cross functional team should support the product manager via: user experience, design expertise,
technical expertise.

# Start With Opportunities

Product canvas assessment template:

* problems or solutions
* users and customers
* solutions used today
* user value
* user metrics
* adoption strategy
* business problems
* business metrics
* budget

# Using Discovery To Build Shared Understanding

Discovery is about getting a deeper/shared understanding. Ask what you're solving, what solutions
could be valuable, what a usable solution looks like, what's feasible to build given the time
we have and our current product.

Discovery steps:

1. frame the idea
2. understand the customers and users, make personas to gain insight
3. envision the solution, how will your customers use it, brainstorm ideas, refine them
4. minimize - cut away and prioritize

# Using Discovery For Validated Learning

Validated learning includes:

1. empathizing - talk directly to users to learn about their challenges/frustrations
2. defining - focus on one or a few problems
3. ideate - brainstorm multiple solutions
4. prototype - build out a prototype to help filter ideas
5. test - have users try out the prototype, learn, and iterate

# Refine, Define, and Build

Team members can participate in the conversations for discovery, refinement, etc...

# Stories Are Actually Like Asteroids

Break down stories just in time:

* for opportunities, discuss what problems are being solved
* for discovery, discuss who/why/how
* for the development strategy, discuss risks
* for the next cycle, pick what to build and make agreements on what "complete" is

# Learn From Everything You Build

Review everything as a team, with people in your organization, with your users. Evaluate releases
and learn from them.
