# Writing Well

Notes on Julian Shapiro's [Writing Well](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro).

Writing well means thinking clearly. Writing is a tool to achieve: leverage, clarity, and social
connection. A single written article can easily reach thousands. Habitual writing requires critical
thinking and clarity. An authentic voice will connect you with interesting people.

It's not just limited to writing either.

# Introductions: Identify What You Should Write About

Choose an *objective* for your article. Then pair it with a *motivation*.

Example objectives:

* teach people how the status quo is wrong
* identify key trends and make a prediction
* contribute original insights
* distill an overwhelming topic into something more approachable
* share a solution
* tell a story (that maybe teaches a lesson too)

Example motivations:

* get something off your chest
* help yourself reason through an unsolved problem
* persuade others to do something you believe is important
* you're obsessed about the topic and just want to share it to others

**A good introduction will hook readers into reading more.** It buys goodwill with your audience
and generates momentum. A hook is a half-told story that teases your talking points. Examples:

* questions - pose an intriguing question
* narratives - share the beginning on a narrative but withhold the conclusion
* discoveries - highlight portions of new findings
* arguments - present your case (but not how you arrived at it just yet)

To generate a hook: ask yourself questions that would make you excited to read it, write those
questions down, rank them by interest. Your hook can simply be the answer to these questions.

"Can you build a significant amount of muscle within three months? How do all the celebrities
playing superheroes do it?" -> Yes, you can build a significant amount of muscle in three months.
I'll walk you through how the celebrities do it.

My favorite hook: "We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones." from Richard Dawkins.

"How can we comfortably live our lives when hundreds of millions still suffer through poverty,
famine, and war -- through no choice of their own?"

The pros of hooks:

* it becomes a talking point. You're forced to write an interesting article to fulfill it.
* it saves your reader time. If they're not interested in the hook, they can safely skip the article.
* you can get feedback immediately by just telling people your hook -- without writing the whole
  article

Combat skepticism of readers by:

* teasing original insights in your intro (if readers are worried about reading unoriginal ideas)
* list points you'll cover (if readers worry about wasting time)
* rewrite your hook to be clear (if readers believe you have bad writing)
* don't over-sell your hook (if readers won't believe you'll answer them)

Ask for feedback and constantly re-write your hooks.

# Writing Process: Generate Insights On Your Topic and Write Your First Draft

**The goal of the first draft is to generate ideas.** Brainstorm talking points. Connect the dots
to learn what you're trying to say.

> When you write a first draft, you write it for yourself. When you rewrite it, you write it
> for everyone else.
> - Stephen King

Work backwards from your objective to identify talking points. Find supporting points (points needed
to make argument) and resulting points (implications of arguments being true).

The first draft process:

1. choose an objective
2. write messy braindump of half-formed thoughts, ideas coming from
   hooks/experience/research/experiments/mental-models
3. transfer best talking points to an outline, especially the ones that are interesting or surprising
4. write first draft using that outline, in your own voice, filling in the gaps of the outline

When filling in the gaps, ask yourself what's needed to convincingly and logically tie your points
together? Your outline will change as you write, go with the flow.

Outros are optional. They can be used to share a poignant takeaway. Or include a relevant quote.
Or provide next steps.

# Rewriting: For Clarity, Succinctness, and Intrigue

**Rewrite in pursuit of three objectives: clarity, succinctness, and intrigue.**

Clear writing is writing readers can follow. Use simple sentences. With plain phrasing. And fewer
ideas per sentence. Prefer concrete examples over abstract, conceptual ideas. Use examples and
counterexamples.

Succinctness is a ratio: meaningful words per paragraph. Remove everything that's not important
to make our point. Ways to be succinct:

1. Rewrite entire sections. Read a section, take a long break, re-write it from memory.
2. Remove unnecessary words.
3. Rephrase paragraphs from scratch.

Be highly intriguing with insights and surprises. People judge an experience based on how they
felt at the most intense part and its end, not the average emotion. So:

1. Have a captivating intro to buy goodwill
2. Have at least one peak of insight or surprise
3. Have an ending that satisfyingly justifies why the piece was worth reading

# Building the Habit: Improving as a Writer

The writing process:

1. Choose a topic
2. Write an intro, use it to brainstorm talking points
3. Get feedback on your intro
4. Create a starting outline
5. Explore talking points within your outline
6. Rewrite for clarity, succinctness, and intrigue
7. Cycle between rewriting, resting, and receiving feedback
8. Copy edit for grammar, word choice, and flow
9. Be satisfied when you've written a piece you'd want to read yourself

Don't have a word count goal. Re-writing reduces word count. Focus on improving the clarity of
your thinking by writing persuasive essays.

Write short posts that persuade your friends to change their minds. Ask them to score it from 1-10
on how much it sustained their interest. Repeat until you're regularly writing 7.5+ posts.

Dissect your favorite posts from your favorite authors.
